<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The writings of many of the women considered
in this volume have sunk into an oblivion
from which their intrinsic merit should have
preserved them. This is partly due to the
fact that nearly all the books on literature have
been written from a man's stand-point. While
in other arts the tastes of men and women vary
little, the choice of novels is to a large degree
determined by sex. Many men who acknowledge
unhesitatingly that Jane Austen is superior
as an artist to Smollett, will find more pleasure
in the breezy adventures of <i>Roderick Random</i>
than in the drawing-room atmosphere of
<i>Emma</i>; while no woman can read a novel of
Smollett's without loathing, although she must
acknowledge that the Scottish writer is a man
of genius.</p>

<p>This book is written from a woman's viewpoint.
Wherever my own judgment has been
different from the generally accepted one, as in
the estimate of some famous heroines, the point
in question has been submitted to other women,
and not recorded unless it met with the approval
of a large number of women of cultivated taste.</p>

<p>This work was first undertaken at the suggestion
of Dr. E. Charlton Black of Boston University
for a Master's thesis, and it was due to his
appreciative words that it was enlarged into
book form. I also wish to thank Professor
Ker of London University, and Dr. Henry A.
Beers and Dr. Wilbur L. Cross of Yale University
for the help which I obtained from them while a
student in their classes. It is with the deepest
sense of gratitude that I acknowledge the
assistance given to me in this work by Mr.
Charles Welsh, at whose suggestion the scope of
the book was enlarged, and many parts strengthened.
I wish especially to thank him for
calling my attention to <i>The Cheap Repository</i>
of Hannah More, and to the literary value of
Maria Edgeworth's stories for children.</p>

<p>It is my only hope that this book may in a
small measure fill a want which a school-girl
recently expressed to me: "Our Club wanted to
study about women, but we have searched the
libraries and found nothing."</p>

<h1>WOMAN'S WORK IN<br />
ENGLISH FICTION</h1>
<hr style="width: 10%;" />


<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<h2>The Duchess of Newcastle. Mrs.
Behn. Mrs. Manley</h2>


<p>In the many volumes containing the records
of the past, the names of few women appear,
and the number is still smaller of those who
have won fame in art or literature. Sappho,
however, has shown that poetic feeling and expression
are not denied the sex; Jeanne d'Arc
was chosen to free France; Mrs. Somerville excelled
in mathematics; Maria Mitchell ranked
among the great astronomers; Rosa Bonheur
had the stroke of a master. These women
possessed genius, and one is tempted to ask
why more women have not left enduring work,
especially in the realm of art. The Madonna and
Child, what a subject for a woman's brush!
Yet the joy of maternity which shines in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
mother's eyes has seldom been expressed by
her in words or on canvas. It was left for a
man, William Blake, to write some of our
sweetest songs of childhood.</p>

<p>But as soon as the novel appeared, a host
of women writers sprang up. Women have
always been story-tellers. Long before Homer
sang of the fall of Troy, the Grecian matrons at
their spinning related to their maids the story
of Helen's infidelity; and, as they thought of
their husbands and sons who had fallen for her
sake, the story did not lack in fervour. But the
minstrels have always had this advantage over
the story-tellers: their words, sung to the lyre,
were crystallised in rhythmic form, so that they
resisted the action of time, while only the substance
of the stories, not the words which gave
them beauty and power, could be retained, and
consequently they crumbled away. When the
novel took on literary form, women began to
write. They were not imitators of men, but
opened up new paths of fiction, in many of
which they excelled.</p>

<p>The first woman to essay prose fiction as
an art was Margaret, Queen of Navarre. In
the seventy-two tales of <i>The Heptameron</i>, a
book written before the dawn of realism, she
related many anecdotes of her brother, Francis
the First, and his courtiers. Woman's permanent
influence over the novel began about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
1640, and was due directly to the Hotel Rambouillet,
in whose grand <i>salon</i> there mingled
freely for half a century the noblest minds
of France. This <i>salon</i> was presided over by
the Marquise de Rambouillet, who had left
the licentious court of Henry the Fourth, and
had formed here in her home between the
Louvre and the Tuileries a little academy,
where Corneille read his tragedies before they
were published, and Bousset preached his first
sermon, while among the listeners were the
beautiful Duchess de Longueville, Madame de
Lafayette, Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute; and Mademoiselle
de Scud&eacute;ri, besides other persons of royal
birth or of genius. The ladies of this <i>salon</i> became
the censors of the manners, the literature,
and even the language of France. Here was
the first group of women writers whose fame extended
beyond their own country, and has lasted,
though somewhat dimmed, to the present.
Since the seventeenth century the influence of
women novelists has been ever widening.</p>

<p>In England, women entered the domain of
literature later than in France, Spain, or Italy.
Not until the Restoration did they take any
active part in the world of letters; and not until
the reign of George the Third did they make any
marked contribution to fiction.</p>

<p>The first woman writer of prose fiction in
England was the thrice noble and illustri<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>ous
Princess Margaret, Duchess of Newcastle.
During the Commonwealth, the Duke and
Duchess of Newcastle had lived in exile, but
with the restoration of Charles the Second, in
1660, they returned to London, where the
Duchess soon became a notable personage.
Crowds gathered in the park merely to see her
pass, attracted partly by her fame as a writer,
partly by the singularities she affected. Her
black coach furnished with white curtains and
adorned with silver trimmings instead of gilt,
with the footmen dressed in long black coats,
was readily distinguished from other carriages
in the park. Her peculiarities of dress were no
less marked. Her long black <i>juste-au-corps</i>, her
hair hanging in curls about her bared neck, her
much beplumed velvet cap of her own designing,
were objects of ridicule to the court wits, who
even asserted that she wore more than the usual
number of black patches upon her comely face.</p>

<p>More singular than her habiliments were her
pretentions as a woman of letters, which caused
the courtiers to laugh at her conceit. She was
evidently aware of this failing as she writes in
her <i>Autobiography</i>: "I fear my ambition inclines
to vain-glory, for I am very ambitious; yet 't is
neither for beauty, wit, titles, wealth, or power,
but as they are steps to raise me to Fame's
tower, which is to live by remembrance in
after-ages."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>But, notwithstanding her detractors, she received
sufficient praise to foster her belief in
her own genius. Her plays were well received.
Her poems were declared by her admirers equal
to Shakespeare's. Her philosophical works,
which she dedicated to the great universities
of Oxford and Cambridge, were accepted with
fulsome flattery of their author. When she
visited the Royal Society at Arundel House, the
Lord President met her at the door, and, with
mace carried before him, escorted her into the
room, where many experiments were performed
for her pleasure. In 1676, a folio volume was
published, entitled <i>Letters and Poems in Honour
of the Incomparable Princess Margaret, Duchess
of Newcastle</i>, written by men of high rank and of
learning, with the following dedication by the
University of Cambridge:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
To Margaret the First:<br />
Princess of Philosophers:<br />
Who hath dispelled errors:<br />
Appeased the difference of opinions:<br />
And restored Peace<br />
To Learning's Commonwealth.<br />
</p></div>

<p>Yet this praise was not all flattery, for the
scholarly Evelyn always speaks of her with
respect, and after visiting her writes, "I was
much pleased with the extraordinary fanciful
habit, garb, and discourse of the Duchess."</p>

<p>Amid the arid wastes of her philosophical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
works are green spots enlivened by good sense
and humour that have a peculiar charm. At
the time when the trained minds of the Royal
Society were broadening scientific knowledge
by careful experiments, this lady, with practically
no education, sat herself down to write
her thoughts upon the great subjects of matter
and motion, mind and body. She was emboldened
to publish her opinions, for, as she
says: "Although it is probable, that some
of the Opinions of Ancient Philosophers in
Ancient times are erroneous, yet not all, neither
are all Modern Opinions Truths, but truly I
believe, there are more Errors in the One
than Truth in the Other." Some of her explanations
are very artless, as when she decides
that passions are created in the heart and not
in the head, because "Passion and Judgment
seldom agree."</p>

<p>Her philosophical works are often compounded
of fiction and fact. Her book called <i>The Description
of a New World called the Blazing World</i>
reminds one of some of the marvellous stories
of Jules Verne. According to the story a
merchant fell in love with a lady while she was
gathering shells on the sea-coast, and carried
her away in a light vessel. They were driven
to the north pole, thence to the pole of another
world which joined it. The conjunction of these
two poles doubled the cold, so that it was insup<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>portable,
and all died but the lady. Bear-men
conducted her to a warmer clime, and presented
her to the emperor of the Blazing World, whose
palace was of gold, with floors of diamonds.
The emperor married the lady, and, at her desire
to study philosophy, sent for the Duchess
of Newcastle, "a plain and rational writer,"
to be her teacher. The story at this point
rambles into philosophy.</p>

<p><i>Nature's Pictures drawn by Fancy's Pencil</i> contains
many suggestions for poems and novels.
Particularly beautiful is the fragment of a story
of a lord and lady who were forbidden to love
in this world, but who died the same night,
and met on the shores of the Styx. "Their
souls did mingle and intermix as liquid essences,
whereby their souls became as one." They
preferred to enjoy themselves thus rather than
go to Elysium, where they might be separated,
and where the talk of the shades was always
of the past, which to them was full of sorrow.</p>

<p>The Duchess of Newcastle wrote a series of
letters on beauty, eloquence, time, theology,
servants, wit, and kindred subjects, often illustrated
by a little story, reminding the reader of
some of the <i>Spectator</i> papers, which delighted the
next generation. As in those papers, characters
were introduced. Mrs. P.I., the Puritan dame,
appears in several letters. She had received
sanctification, and consequently considered all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
vanities of dress, such as curls, bare necks,
black patches, fans, ribbons, necklaces, and
pendants, temptations of Satan and the signs
of damnation. In a subsequent letter she
becomes a preaching sister, and the Duchess
has been to hear her, and thus comments upon
the meeting: "There were a great many holy
sisters and holy brethren met together, where
many took their turns to preach; for as they are
for liberty of conscience, so they are for liberty
of preaching. But there were more sermons
than learning, and more words than reason."</p>

<p>This is the first example of the use of letters
in English fiction. In the next century it was
adopted by Richardson for his three great
novels, <i>Pamela</i>, <i>Clarissa Harlowe</i>, and <i>Sir
Charles Grandison</i>; it was used by Smollett in the
novel of <i>Humphry Clinker</i>, and became a popular
mode of composition with many lesser writers.</p>

<p>But posterity is chiefly indebted to the Duchess
of Newcastle for her life of her husband and
the autobiography that accompanies it. Of the
former Charles Lamb wrote that it was a jewel
for which "no casket is rich enough." Of the
beaux and belles who were drawn by the ready
pens of the playwrights of the court of Charles
the Second none are worthy of a place beside the
Duke of Newcastle and his incomparable wife.</p>

<p>With rare felicity she has described her home
life in London with her brothers and sisters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
before her marriage. Their chief amusements
were a ride in their coaches about the streets of
the city, a visit to Spring Gardens and Hyde
Park; and sometimes a sail in the barges on the
river, where they had music and supper. She
announces with dignity her first meeting with
the Duke of Newcastle in Paris, where she was
maid of honour to the Queen Mother of England:
"He was pleased to take some particular notice of
me, and express more than an ordinary affection
for me; insomuch that he resolved to choose me
for his second wife." And in another place
she writes: "I could not, nor had not the
power to refuse him, by reason my affections were
fixed on him, and he was the only person I
ever was in love with. Neither was I ashamed
to own it, but gloried therein." Here is the
charm of brevity. Richardson would have
blurred these clearly cut sentences by eight
volumes.</p>

<p>In the biography of her husband she relates
faithfully his services to Charles the First at
the head of an army which he himself had
raised; his final defeat near York by the Parliamentary
forces; and his escape to the continent
in 1644. Then followed his sixteen years of
exile in Paris, Rotterdam, and Antwerp, where
"he lived freely and nobly," entertaining many
persons of quality, although he was often in
extreme poverty, and could obtain credit merely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
by the love and respect which his presence
inspired. What a sad picture is given of the
return of the exiles to their estates, which had
been laid waste in the Civil War and later confiscated
by Cromwell! But how the greatness
of the true gentleman shines through it all,
who, as he viewed one of his parks, seven of
which had been completely destroyed, simply
said, "He had been in hopes it would not have
been so much defaced as he found it."</p>

<p>In the closing chapter the Duchess gives
<i>Discourses Gathered from the Mouth of my noble
Lord and Husband</i>. These show both sound
sense and a broad view of affairs. She writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I have heard My Lord say,</p>

<p>I</p>

<p>"That those which command the Wealth of
a Kingdom, command the hearts and hands
of the People.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>XXXIII</p>

<p>"That many Laws do rather entrap than help
the subject."</p></div>

<p>Clarendon, who thought but poorly of the
Duke's abilities as a general, gives the same
characterisation of him: a man of exact proportion,
pleasant, witty, free but courtly in his
manner, who loved all that were his friends,
and hated none that were his enemies, and who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
had proved his loyalty to his king by the sacrifice
of his property and at the risk of his life.</p>

<p>Perhaps the Duchess of Newcastle has unwittingly
drawn a true representation of the
great body of English cavaliers, and has partly
removed the stain which the immoralities of the
court afterward put upon the name. These
biographies give a story of marital felicity with
all the characteristics of the domestic novel.</p>

<p>At this time the English novel was a crude,
formless thing, without dignity in literature.
The Duchess of Newcastle, who aspired to be
ranked with Homer and Plato, would have
spurned a place among writers of romance, although
her genius was primarily that of the
novelist. She constantly thought of plots,
which she jotted down at random, her common
method of composition. She has described
characters, and has left many bright pictures of
the manners and customs of her age. Her
style of writing is better than that of many of
her more scholarly contemporaries, who studied
Latin models and strove to imitate them. She
wrote as she thought and felt, so that her style
is simple when not lost in the mazes of philosophical
speculation. She had all the requisites
necessary to write the great novel of the
Restoration.</p>

<p>But in the next century her voluminous
writings were forgotten, and the casual visitor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
to Westminster Abbey who paused before the
imposing monument in the north transept read
with amused indifference the quaint inscription
which marks the tomb of the noble pair; that she
was the second wife of the Duke of Newcastle,
that her name was Margaret Lucas; "a noble
family, for all the brothers were valiant and
all the sisters were virtuous." To Charles Lamb
belongs the credit of discovering the worth of her
writings. Delighting in oddities, but quick to
discern truth from falsehood, he loved to pore
over the old folios containing her works, and
could not quite forgive his sister Mary for speaking
disrespectfully of "the intellectuals of a dear
favourite of mine of the last century but one&mdash;the
thrice noble, chaste and virtuous, but again
somewhat fantastical and original-brained, generous
Margaret Newcastle."</p>

<p>Her desire for immortality is nearer its fulfilment
to-day than at any previous time. A
third edition of the <i>Life of the Duke of Newcastle</i>
was published in 1675, the year after her
death. Nearly two hundred years later, in 1872,
it was included in Russell Smith's "Library
of Old Authors," and since then a modernised
English edition and a French edition of this
book have been published. No one can read
this biography without feeling the charm of the
quaint, childlike personality of the Duchess of
Newcastle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>While all London was talking of the "mad
Duchess of Newcastle," another lady was living
there no less eminent as a writer, but so distinguished
for her wit, freedom of temper, and
brilliant conversation, that even the great
Dryden sought her friendship, and Sothern,
Rochester, and Wycherley were among her admirers.
She was named "Astrea," and hailed as
the wonder and glory of her sex. But Aphra
Behn's talents brought her a more substantial
reward than fame. Her plays were presented
to crowded houses; her novels were in every
library, and she obtained a large income from
her writings; she was the first English woman
to earn a living by her pen.</p>

<p>In her early youth, Mrs. Behn lived for a time
at Surinam in Dutch Guiana, where her father
was governor. On one of the plantations was
a negro in whose fate she became deeply interested.
She learned from his own lips about
his life in Africa, and was herself an eye witness
of the indignities and tortures he suffered in
slavery. She was so deeply impressed by his
horrible fate, that on her return to London
she related his story to King Charles the Second
and at his request elaborated it into the novel
<i>Oroonoko</i>.</p>

<p>According to the story, Oroonoko, an African
warrior, was married to Imoinda, a beautiful
maiden of his own people. His grandfather, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
powerful chieftain, also fell in love with the
beautiful Imoinda and placed her in his harem.
When he found that her love for Oroonoko still
continued, he sold her secretly into slavery and
her rightful husband could learn nothing of her
whereabouts. Later Oroonoko and his men
were invited by the captain of a Dutch trading
ship to dine on board his vessel. They accepted
the invitation, but, after dinner, the captain
seized his guests, threw them into chains, and
carried them to the West Indies, where he sold
them as slaves. Here Oroonoko found his
wife, whose loss he had deeply mourned, and
they were reunited. Oroonoko, however, indignant
at the treachery practised against himself
and his men, incited the slaves to a revolt.
They were overcome, and Oroonoko was tied
to a whipping-post and severely punished. As
he found that he could not escape, he resolved
to die. But rather than leave Imoinda to the
cruelty of her owners, he determined to slay
first his wife, then his enemies, lastly himself.
He told his plans to Imoinda, who willingly
accompanied him into the forest, where he put
her to death. When he saw his wife dead at his
feet, his grief was so great that it deprived him
of the strength to take vengeance on his enemies.
He was again captured and led to a stake,
where faggots were placed about him. The author
has described his death with a faithfulness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
to detail that carries with it the impress of
truth: "'My Friends, am I to die, or to be
whipt?' And they cry'd, 'Whipt! no, you
shall not escape so well.' And then he reply'd,
smiling, 'A blessing on thee'; and assured them
they need not tie him, for he would stand fix'd
like a Rock, and endure Death so as should
encourage them to die: 'But if you whip me'
[said he], 'be sure you tie me fast.'"</p>

<p>The popularity of the book was instantaneous.
It passed through several editions. It was translated
into French and German, and adapted for
the German stage, while Sothern put it on the
stage in England. It created almost as great a
sensation as did <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i> two hundred
years later. Like Mrs. Stowe's novel it had a
strong moral influence, as it was among the
earliest efforts to call the attention of Europe
to the evils of the African slave trade. Moreover,
this her first novel gave Mrs. Behn an
acknowledged place as a writer.</p>

<p><i>Oroonoko</i> marks a distinct advance in English
fiction. Nearly all novels before this had
consisted of a series of stories held together by
a loosely formed plot running through a number
of volumes, sometimes only five, but occasionally,
as in <i>The Grand Cyrus</i>, filling ten quartos.
Their form was such that like the <i>Thousand and
One Nights</i> they could be continued indefinitely.
Most of these novels belonged either<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
to the pastoral romance or the historical allegory.
In the former the ladies and gentlemen who in a
desultory sort of way carried on the plot were
disguised as shepherds and shepherdesses and
lived in idyllic state in Arcadia. In the latter
they masqueraded under the names of kings and
queens of antiquity and entered with the flourish
of trumpets and the sound of drums.</p>

<p><i>Oroonoko</i> was the first English novel with a
well developed plot. It moves along rapidly,
without digression, to its tragic conclusion.
Not until Fielding wrote <i>Joseph Andrews</i> was
the plot of any English novel so definitely
wrought. The lesser writer had a slight advantage
over the greater. Mrs. Behn's novel
is constructed upon dramatic lines, so that it
holds the interest more closely to the main
characters, and the end is awaited with intense
expectation; while Fielding chose the epic form,
which is more discursive, and <i>Joseph Andrews</i>
like all his novels is excessively tame, almost
hackneyed in its conclusion. Mrs. Behn's black
hero is the first distinctly drawn character in
English fiction, the first one that has any
marked personality. Sometimes the enthusiasm
with which he is described brings a smile to the
lips of the modern reader and reminds one of
the heroic savages of James Fenimore Cooper
and Helen Hunt Jackson. She writes of him:
"He was pretty tall, but of a Shape the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
exact that can be Fancy'd: The most famous
Statuary could not form the Figure of a Man
more admirably turned from Head to Foot....
There was no one Grace wanting, that bears the
Standard of true Beauty." And thus she continues
the description in the superlative degree.</p>

<p>But the story is for the most part realistic.
Although the scenes in Africa show the influence
of the French heroic novels, as if the author were
afraid to leave her story in its simple truth but
must adorn it with purple and ermine, as soon
as it is transferred to Surinam, where Mrs. Behn
had lived, it becomes real. It has local colouring,
at that time an almost unknown attribute. It
has the atmosphere of the tropics. The descriptions
are vivid, and often photographic.
Occasionally they are exaggerated, but few travellers
to a region of which their hearers know
nothing have been able to resist the temptation
to deviate from the exact truth. But the
whole novel, even at this late day, leaves one
with the impression that it is a true biography.</p>

<p>In the history of the English novel, in which
<i>Pamela</i> is given an important place as the
morning star which heralded the great light of
English realism about to burst upon the world,
this well arranged, definite, picturesque story
of <i>Oroonoko</i>, whose author was reposing quietly
within the hallowed precincts of Westminster
Abbey fifty years before Richardson introduced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
<i>Pamela</i> to an admiring public, should not be
forgotten. Before <i>Pamela</i> was published, the
complete works of Mrs. Behn passed through
eight editions. The plots of all her novels are
well constructed, with little extraneous matter,
but with the exception of Oroonoko the characters
are shadowy beings, many of whom meet
with a violent death. <i>The Nun or the Perjured
Duty</i> has only five characters, all of whom perish
in the meshes of love. <i>The Fair Jilt or the
Amours of Prince Tarquin and Miranda</i>, founded
on incidents that came to the author's knowledge
during her residence in Antwerp, is well fitted
for the columns of a modern yellow journal; the
beautiful heroine causes the death of everyone
who stands in the way of her love or her ambition,
but she finally repents and lives happy
ever after. Mrs. Behn's style is always careless,
owing to her custom of writing while entertaining
friends.</p>

<p>A great change took place in the public taste
during the next hundred years, so that Mrs.
Behn's novels, plays, and poems fell into disrepute.
Sir Walter Scott tells the story of his
grand-aunt who expressed a desire to see again
Mrs. Behn's novels, which she had read with delight
in her youth. He sent them to her sealed
and marked "private and confidential." The
next time he saw her, she gave them back
with the words:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>"Take back your bonny Mrs. Behn, and, if
you will take my advice, put her in the fire, for
I find it impossible to get through the very first
novel. But is it not a very odd thing that I,
an old woman of eighty and upward, sitting
alone, feel myself ashamed to read a book which
sixty years ago I have heard read aloud for the
amusement of large circles, consisting of the
first and most creditable society in London?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Behn has been accused of great license in
her conduct and of gross immorality in her
writings. Her friend and biographer says of the
former: "For my part I knew her intimately,
and never saw ought unbecoming the just
modesty of our sex, though more free and gay
than the folly of the precise will allow." For
the latter the fashion must be blamed more than
she. Mrs. Behn was not actuated by the high
moral principles of Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri
and Madame de Lafayette, with whom love
was an ennobling passion, nor was she writing
for the refined men and women of the Hotel
Rambouillet; she was striving to earn a living
by pleasing the court of Charles the Second,
and in that she was eminently successful.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Nearly a quarter of a century after the death
of Mrs. Behn, Mrs. Manley published anonymously
the first two volumes of the <i>New Atlantis</i>,
the book by which she is chiefly known,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
under the title of <i>Secret Memoirs and Manners of
Several Persons of Quality of both Sexes from the
New Atalantis, an Island in the Mediterranean</i>.
Mrs. Manley was a Tory, and she peopled the
New Atalantis with members of the Whig party
under Marlborough as Prince Fortunatus. The
book is written in the form of a conversation
carried on by Astrea, Virtue, and Intelligence, a
personification of the <i>Court Gazette</i>. They described
the Whig leaders so accurately, and
related the scandal of the court so faithfully,
that, although fictitious names were used, no
key was needed to recognise the personages in
the story.</p>

<p>The publisher and printer were arrested for
libel, but Mrs. Manley came forward and owned
the authorship. In her trial she was placed
under a severe cross-examination by Lord Sunderland,
who attempted to learn where she
had obtained her information. She persisted
in her statement that no real characters were
meant, that it was all a work of imagination,
but if it bore any resemblance to truth it must
have come to her by inspiration. Upon Lord
Sunderland's objecting to this statement, on the
grounds that so immoral a book bore no trace
of divine impulse, she replied that there were
evil angels as well as good, who might possess
equal powers of inspiration. The book was
published in May, 1709; in the following Febru<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>ary,
she was discharged by order of the Queen's
Bench.</p>

<p>Soon after her discharge from court, she wrote
a third and fourth volume of the <i>New Atalantis</i>
under the title, <i>Memoirs of Europe toward the
Close of the Eighth Century written by Eginardus,
Secretary and Favorite to Charlemagne, and done
into English, by the Translator of the New Atalantis</i>.
Here she has followed the French models.
There is a loosely constructed plot, and the
characters tell a series of stories. Many of the
writers of Queen Anne's reign are described
with none of that lustre that surrounds them
now, but as they appeared to a cynical woman
who knew them well. She refers to Steele as
Don Phaebo, and ridicules his search for the
philosopher's stone; and laments that Addison,
whom she calls Maro, should prostitute his
talents for gold, when he might become a second
Vergil.</p>

<p>Mrs. Manley had been well trained to write a
book like the <i>New Atalantis</i>. At sixteen, an
age when Addison and Steele were at the Charterhouse
preparing for Oxford, her father, Sir
Roger Manley, died. A cousin, taking advantage
of her helplessness, deceived her by a
false marriage, and after three years abandoned
her. Upon this she entered the household of the
Duchess of Cleveland, the mistress of Charles
the Second, who soon tired of her and dismissed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
her from her service. She then began to write,
and by her plays and political articles soon won
an acknowledged place among the writers of
Grub Street.</p>

<p>From the many references to her in the letters
and journals of the period, she seems to have
been popular with the writers of both political
parties. Swift writes to Stella that she is a
very generous person "for one of that sort,"
which many little incidents prove. She dedicated
her play <i>Lucius</i> to Steele, with whom she
was on alternate terms of enmity and friendship,
as a public retribution for her ridicule of him in
the <i>New Atalantis</i>, saying that "scandal between
Whig and Tory goes for not." Steele, equally
generous, wrote a prologue for the play, perhaps
in retribution for some of the harsh criticisms
of her in the <i>Tatler</i>. All readers of Pope remember
the reference to her in the <i>Rape of the Lock</i>,
where Lord Petre exclaims that his honour, name
and praise shall live</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
As long as Atalantis shall be read.<br />
</p></div>

<p>Although Mrs. Manley's pen was constantly
and effectively employed in the interest of the
Tory party, she being at one time the editor of
the <i>Examiner</i>, the Tory organ, none of her writings
had the popularity of the <i>New Atalantis</i>.
It went through seven editions and was translated
into the French. The book has no intrinsic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
merit; its language is scurrilous and obscene;
but it appealed to the eager curiosity of the
public concerning the private immoralities of
men and women who were prominent at court.
Human nature in its pages furnishes a contemptible
spectacle.</p>

<p>The <i>New Atalantis</i> has now, however, assumed
a permanent place in the history of fiction.
This species of writing had been common,
in France, but it was the first English novel
in which political and personal scandal formed
the groundwork of a romance. Swift followed
its general plan in <i>Gulliver's Travels</i>, placing his
political enemies in public office in Lilliput and
Brobdingnag, only he so wrought upon them
with his imagination that he gave to the world
a finished work of art, while Mrs. Manley has
left only the raw material with which the artist
works. Smollett's political satire, <i>Adventures of
an Atom</i>, was also suggested by the <i>New Atalantis</i>,
but here the earlier writer has surpassed the
later. All three of these writers took a low and
cynical view of humanity.</p>

<p>The women novelists who directly followed
Mrs. Manley did not have her strength, but
they had a delicacy that has given to their
writings a subtle charm. From the time of
Sarah Fielding to the present threatened reaction
the writings of women have been marked by
chastity of thought and purity of expression.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<h2>Sarah Fielding. Mrs. Lennox.
Mrs. Haywood. Mrs. Sheridan</h2>


<p>About the middle of the eighteenth century,
some interesting novels were written by
women, but their fame was so overshadowed
by the early masters of English fiction, who
were then writing, that they have been almost
forgotten. For in 1740 <i>Pamela</i> was published,
the first novel of Samuel Richardson; in 1771,
<i>Humphry Clinker</i> appeared, the last novel
of Tobias Smollett; and during the thirty-one
years between these two dates all the books
of Richardson, Fielding, Sterne, and Smollett
were given to the world, and determined the
nature of the English novel. The plot of most
of their fifteen realistic novels is practically the
same. The hero falls in love with a beautiful
young lady, not over seventeen, and there is a
conflict between lust and chastity. The hero,
balked of his prey, travels up and down the
world, where he meets with a series of adventures,
all very much alike, and all bearing very
little on the main plot. At last fate leads the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
dashing hero to the church door, where he confers
a ring on the fair heroine, a paltry piece of
gold, the only reward for her fidelity, with the
hero thrown in, much the worse for wear, and
the curtain falls with the sound of the wedding
bells in the distance.</p>

<p>The range of these novels is narrow. They
describe a world in which the chief occupation
is eating, drinking, swearing, gambling, and
fighting. Their chief artistic excellence is the
strength and vigour with which these low scenes
are described. Sidney Lanier says of them:
"They play upon life as upon a violin without
a bridge, in the deliberate endeavour to get the
most depressing tones possible from the instrument."
And Taine, who could hardly endure
any of them, writes of Fielding what he implies
of the others: "One thing is wanted in your
strongly-built folks&mdash;refinement; the delicate
dreams, enthusiastic elevation, and trembling
delicacy exist in nature equally with coarse
vigour, noisy hilarity, and frank kindness."</p>

<p>The women who essayed the art of fiction during
these years did not have so firm a grasp of
the pen as their male contemporaries, and they
have added no portraits to the gallery of fiction;
but they saw and recorded many interesting
scenes of British life which quite escaped
the quick-sighted Fielding, or Sterne with the
microscopic eyes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1744, when Richardson had written only one
book, and Fielding had published only two, before
<i>Tom Jones</i> or <i>Clarissa Harlowe</i> had seen the light
of day, Sarah Fielding published <i>David Simple</i>,
under the title of <i>The Adventures of David Simple,
containing an account of his travels through the
cities of London and Westminster in the search of
a real friend, by a Lady</i>. The author commenced
the story as a satire on society. For a long time
David's search is unsuccessful. Although he
changed his lodgings every week, he could hear
of no one who could be trusted. Many, to be sure,
dropped hints of their own excellence, and the
pity that they had to live with inferior neighbours.
Among these was Mr. Spatter, who introduced
him to Mr. Varnish. The former saw the
faults of people through a magnifying glass;
while the latter, when he mentioned a person's
failings, added, "He was sure they had some
good in them." But David soon learned that
Mr. Varnish was no readier to assist a friend in
need than the fault-finding Mr. Spatter.</p>

<p>Like her brother Henry, Sarah Fielding is
often sarcastic. In one of the chapters she
leaves David to his sufferings, "lest it should
be thought," she added, "I am so ignorant
of the world as not to know the proper time of
forsaking people." But the pessimistic vein of
the first volume changes to a more optimistic
tone in the second. David, in his search for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
one friend, finds three. Fortunately these consist
of a brother and sister and a lady in love
with the brother. Even at this early time, an
author had no doubts as to how a novel should
end. The heading of the last chapter in the
book informs us that it contains two weddings,
"and consequently the Conclusion of the
Book."</p>

<p>In its construction, the plot is similar to that
of the other novels of the period. David has
plenty of time at his disposal, and listens with
more patience than the reader to the detailed
history of all the people he meets, and often
begs a casual acquaintance to favour him with
the story of his life.</p>

<p>But Sarah Fielding's chief charm to her women
readers is the feminine view of her times. In
<i>David Simple</i> we have the pleasure of travelling
through England, but with a woman as our
guide. As Harry Fielding travelled between
Bath and London, the fair reader wonders what
he reported to Mrs. Fielding of what he had seen
and heard. Surely at these various inns there
must have been some by-play of real affection,
some act of modest kindness, some incident of
delicate humour. Did he regale Mrs. Fielding
with the scenes he has described for his readers?
Probably when she asked him if anything had
happened <i>en route</i>, he merely yawned and replied,
"Oh, nothing worth while." He had too much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
reverence for his wife to repeat these low scenes
to her, and we suspect he had eyes for no others.
What would Addison or Steele have seen in the
same place?</p>

<p>Sarah Fielding also takes her characters on a
stage-coach journey, but here we sit beside the
fair heroine, an intelligent lady, and gaze at the
men who sit opposite her. There is the Butterfly
with his hair pinned up in blue papers, wearing
a laced waistcoat, and humming an Italian air.
He admires nothing but the ladies, and offered
some little familiarity to our heroine, which
she repulsed; upon this he paid her the greatest
respect imaginable, being convinced, as she
would not suffer any intimacy from <i>him</i>, she
must be one of the most virtuous women that
had ever been born. There is the Atheist, who
being alone with her for a few moments makes
love to her in an insinuating manner, and tries
to prove to her that pleasure is the only thing to
be sought in life, and assures her that she may
follow her inclinations without a crime, "while
she knew that nothing could so much oppose her
<i>gratifying him</i>, as her <i>pleasing herself</i>." Then
there is the Clergyman who makes honourable
love to her, but by doing so puts an end to the
friendship which she had hoped might be between
them; until at the end of the journey, "she
almost made a resolution never to speak to a
man again, beginning to think it impossible for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
a man to be civil to a woman, unless he had
some designs upon her."</p>

<p>Whether or not women have ever portrayed the
masculine sex truthfully is an open question.
But a gentleman mellowed and softened in the
light of ladies' smiles is quite a different creature
from the same gentleman when seen among
the sterner members of his own sex, and there
are certain phases of men's characters portrayed
in the novels of women which Fielding, Scott,
and Thackeray seem never to have seen.</p>

<p>Miss Fielding descants upon many familiar
scenes in a manner that would have made her a
valuable contributor to the <i>Tatler</i> or <i>Spectator</i>.
All kinds of human nature interested her. There
is the man who advises David as a friend to buy a
certain stock which he himself is secretly trying
to sell because he knows it has decreased in value,
thus showing that money transactions in London
in the reigns of the Georges differed little from
money transactions on the Stock Exchange
to-day. In some respects, however, society has
improved since the days of Sarah Fielding. She
describes the gentlemen of social prominence
who tumble up to the carriages of ladies who
are driving through Covent Garden in the
morning, and present them with cabbages or
other vegetables which they have picked up
from the stalls, too intoxicated to know that
their conduct is ridiculous. There are the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
crowds at the theatres who show their displeasure
with a playwright by making so much noise
that his play cannot be heard on its first night
and so is condemned. Other writers of the
period complain of having received this kind of
treatment at the hands of the gentlemen mob.
And then we are introduced to a scene in the
fashionable West End which is a familiar one
to-day, where the ladies of quality have their
whist assemblies and spend all the morning
visiting each other and discussing how the
cards were played the previous evening and
why certain tricks were lost.</p>

<p>We recognise the fact, however, that Miss
Fielding's knowledge of life was but slight.
She writes from the standpoint of a spectator, not
like her brother as one who had been a part of it.
She was one of that group of gentlewomen
who gathered around Richardson and heard him
read <i>Clarissa</i>, or discussed life and books with
him at the breakfast table in the summer-house
at North End, Hammersmith. Life was not
lived there, but philosophy often sat at the
board, and there was fine penetration into the
characters and manners of men. Richardson
transferred to Miss Fielding the compliment
which Dr. Johnson had bestowed upon him, and
it was not undeserved by the author of <i>David
Simple</i>:</p>

<p>"What a knowledge of the human heart!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
Well might a critical judge of writing say, as he
did to me, that your late brother's knowledge
of it was not (fine writer as he was) comparable
to yours. His was but as the knowledge of the
outside of a clock-work machine, while yours
was that of all the finer springs and movements
of the inside."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It is not difficult to conjure up a picture of the
literary gentlemen and gentlewomen who used
to breakfast with Richardson in the summer-house
at North End; the gentlemen in their
many-coloured velvet suits, the ladies wearing
broad hoops, loose sacques, and Pamela hats.
One of these ladies was Charlotte Ramsay,
better known by her married name of Mrs.
Lennox. Her father, Colonel James Ramsay,
was lieutenant-governor of New York, where
his daughter Charlotte was born in 1720. She
was sent to England at the age of fifteen, and
soon after her father died, leaving her unprovided
for. She turned her attention to literature as a
means of livelihood, and at once became a
favourite in the literary circles of London, where
she met and won the esteem of the great Dr.
Johnson.</p>

<p>When her first novel, <i>The Life of Harriet
Stuart</i>, was published, he showed his appreciation
of its author in a unique manner. At his
suggestion, the Ivy Lane Club and its friends<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
entertained Mrs. Lennox and her husband at
the Devil's Tavern with a night of festivity.
After an elaborate supper had been served, a
hot apple-pie was brought in, stuffed full of
bay-leaves, and Johnson with appropriate ceremonies
crowned the author with a wreath
of laurel. The night was passed in mirth and
conversation; tea and coffee were often served;
and not until the creaking of the street doors
reminded them that it was eight o'clock in the
morning did the guests, twenty in number, leave
the tavern.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lennox's claim to a place in English
literature rests solely upon her novel, <i>The
Female Quixote</i>, published in 1752. Arabella,
the heroine, is the daughter of a marquis who
has retired into the country, where he lives
remote from society. Her mother is dead; her
father is immersed in his books, so that Arabella
is left alone, and whiles away the hours by
reading the novels of Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri.
Her three great novels, <i>Clelia</i>, <i>The Grand
Cyrus</i> and <i>Ibrahim</i>, are historical allegories,
in which the France of Louis XIV is given an
historical setting, and his courtiers masquerade
under the names of famous men of antiquity.
There is no attempt at historical accuracy.
But to Arabella these books represented true
history and depicted the real life of the world.</p>

<p>In a fine satirical passage Arabella informs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
Mr. Selvin, a man so deeply read in ancient
history that he fixed the date of any occurrence
by Olympiads, not years, that Pisistratus had
been inspired to enslave his country because of
his love for Cleorante. Mr. Selvin wonders
how this important fact could have escaped his
own research, and conceives a great admiration
for Arabella's learning.</p>

<p>In the novels of Mademoiselle de Scud&eacute;ri the
characters, even in moments of extreme danger,
entertain each other with stories of their past
experiences. When Arabella has unexpected
guests she bids her maid relate to them the history
of her mistress. She instructs her to "relate
exactly every change of my countenance,
number all my smiles, half-smiles, blushes, turnings
pale, glances, pauses, full-stops, interruptions;
the rise and falling of my voice, every
motion of my eyes, and every gesture which I
have used for these ten years past: nor omit
the smallest circumstance that relates to me."</p>

<p>All the people Arabella meets are changed by
her fancy into the characters of her favourite
books. In common people she sees princes in
disguise. If a man approaches her, she fancies
that he is about to bear her away to some remote
castle, or to mention the subject of love,
which would be unpardonable, unless he had
first captured cities in her behalf. Yet amid the
wildest extravagances Arabella never loses her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
charm. Her generosity and purity of thought
make her a very lovable heroine, much more
womanly than Clarissa or Sophia Western, and
we do not wonder that Mr. Glanville continues
to love her, although he is so often annoyed by
her ridiculous fancies.</p>

<p>But her belief in her hallucinations is as firm
as that of the Spanish Quixote for whom the
book was named. Everyone will remember
his attack on the windmills, which he mistook
for giants. Arabella was equally brave. Thinking
herself and some other ladies pursued, when
the Thames cuts off their escape, she addresses
her companions in language becoming one of
her favourite heroines: "Once more, my fair
Companions, if your honour be dear to you, if
an immortal glory be worth your seeking,
follow the example I shall set you, and equal, with
me, the Roman Clelia." She plunged into the
river, but was promptly rescued. The doctor
who attended her in the illness that followed
this heroic deed convinced her of the folly of
trying to live according to these old books,
and she consented to marry her faithful and
deserving lover.</p>

<p>The character of Arabella is not drawn with
the broad strong lines of Fielding, nor with the
attention to minute detail which gives life to the
characters of Richardson. But the girlish sweetness
of Arabella, her refusal to believe wrong of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
others, her ignorance of life, her contempt for
a lover who has not shed blood nor captured
cities in her behalf, is a reality, and shows that
the author knew the nature of the romantic
girl. In the noble simplicity of Arabella, Mrs.
Lennox has, perhaps unconsciously, paid a high
tribute to the moral effects of the novels of
Scud&eacute;ri. Arabella is the only clearly drawn
character in the book. But one humorous
situation follows another, so that the interest
never flags.</p>

<p>The other novels of Mrs. Lennox have no
value save as they show the trend of thought
of the period. In <i>Henrietta</i>, afterward dramatised
as <i>The Sister</i>, the heroine, granddaughter
of an earl, rather than change her
religion, leaves her family and becomes the
maid of a rich but vulgar tradesman's daughter.
Of course her mistress, who has treated her
scurrilously, in time learns her true rank and is
properly humbled. The name given to one of the
chapters might suffice for the most of them:
"In which our heroine is in great distress."</p>

<p>This would seem to be the proper heading
for many chapters of many books of the period.
In the days of Good Queen Bess, heroines were
good and happy. In the merry reign of Charles,
they were bad but happy. Pamela set a
fashion from which heroines seldom dared to
deviate for over a hundred years. They were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
good&mdash;but, oh, so wretched! This type of
women became such a favourite with both
sexes, that even the sane-minded Scott says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
And love is loveliest when embalmed in tears.<br />
</p></div>

<p>During her period of distress Henrietta
lodged with a milliner. Her landlady showed
her a small collection of books and pointed with
especial pleasure to her favourite novels:
"There is Mrs. Haywood's Novels, did you
ever read them? Oh! they are the finest love-sick
passionate stories: I assure you, you'll
like them vastly." Henrietta, however, chose
<i>Joseph Andrews</i> for her diversion. Mrs. Eliza
Haywood was never admitted into that inner
circle of highly respectable English ladies who
clustered around Richardson. She was more
of an adventuress in the domain of letters.
In her first novels she followed the fashion set
by Mrs. Manley and supplied the public with
scandals in high life. <i>Memoirs of a Certain
Island Adjacent to Utopia</i>, published in 1725,
<i>The Secret Intrigues of the Count of Caramania</i>,
published in 1727, are the highly suggestive titles
of two of the most popular of her early works.</p>

<p>After Richardson had made Virtue more popular
than Vice, Mrs. Haywood followed the literary
fashion which he had set, and in 1751
wrote <i>The History of Miss Betsey Thoughtless</i>.
This has sometimes been called a domestic novel,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
but that is a misnomer, since the characters
are seldom found at home, but rather are met
in the various pleasure resorts of London. As
was the fashion in the novels of this time, and
probably not an uncommon occurrence in the
English capital, the heroine was often forced
into a chariot by some lawless libertine, but
fortunately was always rescued by some more
virtuous lover. The whole story is but a new
arrangement of the one or two incidents with
which Richardson had wrung the heart of the
British public. It has one advantage over the
most of the novels which had preceded it.
There is little told that does not bear directly on
the plot, the characters of the sub-plot being
important personages in the main story, and the
book has a definite conclusion.</p>

<p>None of the characters, however, are pleasing.
The hero, Mr. Trueworthy, a combination of
Tom Jones and Sir Charles Grandison, is a
hypocrite. The other male characters are insignificant.
Miss Betsey, the heroine, is almost
charming. Conscious of her own innocence, she
repeatedly appears in a light that makes her
worldly lover, Mr. Trueworthy, suspect her
virtue, until at last he begs to be released from
his engagement to her. The author of the book
stands as a duenna at Miss Betsey's side, and
points out by the misfortunes of the heroine
how foolish it is for girls to ignore public opinion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
and strives to inculcate the lesson that a husband
is the best protection for a young girl. We are
properly shocked at Miss Betsey's levity, who,
although she had arrived at the mature age
of fourteen, cared not a straw for any of the
gentlemen who sought her hand, but liked to
have them about her only because they flattered
her vanity or afforded her a subject for mirth.
Miss Betsey's gaiety, wit, and generosity would
be very attractive&mdash;in fact, she is quite an up-to-date
young lady&mdash;but we see how much better
she would "get on" if she had a little more
worldly wisdom. She is punished, as she deserves
to be, by losing her lover, and marries a man
who makes her very unhappy. Mr. Trueworthy,
however, learns of her innocence; her husband
fortunately dies, and the author takes
the bold step of uniting the widow to her
former lover, after a year of mourning and
passing through much suffering, brought upon
herself by her own thoughtlessness. She is rewarded,
however, very much as Pamela was
rewarded, by marrying a man of honour, who
had judged her formerly by his own conduct,
being too willing to believe by appearances that
she had lost her chastity, or, at least, had sullied
her good name.</p>

<p>In this novel, Mrs. Haywood is very near the
line that divides the artist from the artisan.
Like a young girl with good health and good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
spirits, Miss Betsey is ever on the verge of
sweeping aside the prejudices of her duenna, and
asserting her own individuality, but is constantly
held back by the sense of worldly propriety.
Had Mrs. Haywood permitted Miss Betsey to
carry the plot whither she would without let or
hindrance, she would have won for herself an
acknowledged place among the heroines of
fiction.</p>

<p><i>The History of Miss Betsey Thoughtless</i> was
an epoch-making book. The adventures of its
heroine in the city of London took possession of
the imagination of Fanny Burney, while little
more than a child, and led to the story of <i>Evelina</i>,
the forerunner of Jane Austen and her school.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The fashion for weeping heroines was at its
height, when, in 1761, Mrs. Francis Sheridan
published <i>The Memoirs of Miss Sidney Biddulph</i>.
The story is written in the form of letters, in
which the heroine reveals to a friend of her
own sex all the secrets of her heart. All London
rejoiced over the virtues of Sidney Biddulph,
and wept over her sorrows. She had
been educated "in the strictest principles of
virtue; from which she never deviated, through
the course of an innocent, though unhappy
life." It was so pathetic a story that Dr.
Johnson doubted if Mrs. Sheridan had a right
to make her characters suffer so much, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
Charles James Fox, who sat up all night to read
it, pronounced it the best of all novels of his
time.</p>

<p>The book, as first written, was in three volumes.
The author had brought the story to a most
fitting close. Both Sidney's husband and the
man whom she had really loved were dead, and
the widow could have spent her days in pleasing
melancholy, contented with the thought that
she had never done a wrong. But the public
demanded a continuation of the story. In
1767, two volumes were added, giving the history
of Sidney's daughters, who seem to have
inherited from their mother the enmity of
the fates, for their sufferings were as great as
hers.</p>

<p>Authors are prone to draw upon their own
history for the emotions they depict. But Mrs.
Sheridan's life did not furnish the tragic elements
of <i>Sidney Biddulph</i>, although it was not
without romance. Before her marriage, she
wrote a pamphlet in praise of the conduct of one
Thomas Sheridan, the manager of the Theatre
Royal in Dublin, during a riot that occurred in
the theatre. Sheridan read these words in his
praise, sought the acquaintance of their author,
and before long married her.</p>

<p>History furnishes a long list of women of talent
whose sons were men of genius. Mrs. Sheridan's
second son, Richard Brinsley, the author of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
light and sparkling <i>Rivals</i>, inherited his mother's
talents without her gloom. But Mrs. Sheridan
also had some ability as a writer of comedy,
and the most famous character of the <i>Rivals</i>
was first sketched by her. In a comedy, <i>A
Journey to Bath</i>, declined by Garrick, one of
the characters was Mrs. Twyford, whom Richard
Brinsley Sheridan transformed into that famous
blundering coiner of words, Mrs. Malaprop.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sheridan's place in literature rests upon
<i>Sidney Biddulph</i>. This novel was an innovation
in English fiction. Nearly one hundred years
earlier, Madame de Lafayette had written <i>The
Princess of Cl&egrave;ves</i>, one of the most nearly perfect
novels that has ever been written, and the first
that depended for its interest, not alone on
what was done, but on the subtle workings of
the human heart which led to the doing of it.
From that time the novels of French women
were largely introspective. English women,
however, were either less interested in the
inner life, or more reserved in laying bare its
secrets. <i>Sidney Biddulph</i> was the first English
novel of this kind, and it left no definite
trace on fiction, although it was the favourite
novel of Charlotte Smith and had some slight
effect upon her writings, and Mrs. Inchbald,
Mrs. Opie, and Mary Brunton noted the feelings
of their characters. Not until <i>Jane Eyre</i> was
published, long after Mrs. Sheridan had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
forgotten, was there any great English novel
of the inner life.</p>

<p>In its day <i>Sidney Biddulph</i> was exceedingly
popular on the continent of Europe as well
as in England. It was translated into German,
and an adaptation of it was made in French by
the Abb&eacute; Pr&eacute;vost, under the title, <i>Memoirs pour
servir a l'histoire de la vertu</i>. But after all,
Sidney's sorrows were not real, or she herself
was not real; and we of to-day smile or yawn
over the pages that drew tears from the eyes of
the mighty Dr. Johnson.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Notwithstanding the many excellencies of English
fiction during the middle of the eighteenth
century, it was held in low repute. There
had been many writers attempting to portray
real life who, without the genius of the greater
novelists, could imitate only their faults. In
the preface to <i>Polly Honeycomb</i>, which was
acted at Drury Lane theatre in 1760, George
Colman, the author, gives the titles of about two
hundred novels whose names appeared in a circulating
library at that time. <i>Amorous Friars,
or the Intrigues of a Convent</i>; <i>Beauty put to its
Shifts, or the Young Virgin's Rambles</i>; <i>Bubbled
Knights, or Successful Contrivances, plainly evincing,
in two Familiar Instances lately transacted
in this Metropolis, the Folly and Unreasonableness
of Parents Laying a Restraint upon their Children's</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
<i>Inclinations in the Affairs of Love and
Marriage</i>; <i>The Impetuous Lover, or the Guiltless
Parricide</i>; these are the titles of a few of the
popular books of that period. Colman in the
character of Polly Honeycomb, an earlier Lydia
Languish, attempts to show the moral effects of
such reading. Her head had been so turned by
these books that her father exclaims, "A man
might as well turn his daughter loose in Covent-Garden,
as trust the cultivation of her mind to
<small>A CIRCULATING LIBRARY</small>."</p>

<p>Fiction at this time lacked delicacy and
refinement. The characters lived largely in the
streets or taverns, and were too much engrossed
in the pleasures of active life to give any heed to
thoughts or emotions. Though love was the
constant theme of these books, as yet no true love
story had been written. The fires of home had
not been lighted. The refinements, the pure affections,
the high ideals which cluster around
the domestic hearth had as yet no place in the
novel. It needed the feminine element, which,
while no broader than that which had previously
made the novel, by its own addition
gave something new to it and made it truer to
life.</p>

<p>While no woman of marked genius had appeared,
the number and influence of women
novelists continued to increase throughout the
eighteenth century. Tim Cropdale in the novel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
<i>Humphry Clinker</i>, who "had made shift to
live many years by writing novels, at the
rate of five pounds a volume," complains that
"that branch of business is now engrossed by
female authors, who publish merely for the propagation
of virtue, with so much ease, and spirit,
and delicacy, and knowledge of the human
heart, and all in the serene tranquillity of high
life, that the reader is not only enchanted by
their genius, but reformed by their morality."
Schlosser in his <i>History of the Eighteenth Century</i>
pays this tribute to the moral influence of the
women novelists: "With the increase of the
number of writers in England in the course of
the eighteenth century, women began to appear
as authors instead of educating their children,
and their influence upon morals and modes
of thinking increased, as that of the clergy
diminished."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<h2>Fanny Burney</h2>


<p>A noteworthy transformation took place
in the English novel during the late years
of the eighteenth century and the early part of
the nineteenth. This change cannot be explained
by the great difference in manners only. The
mode of life described by the early novelists was
in existence sixty years after they wrote scenes
typical of the customs and manners of their
day, just as the quiet home life described by
Miss Austen was to be found in England a
hundred years before it graced the pages of a
book. This new era in the English novel was
due not to a change of environment, but to the
new ideals of those who wrote.</p>

<p>In 1778, English fiction was represented by
the work of Miss Burney, and for thirty-six
years, until 1814, when <i>Waverley</i> appeared, this
rare plant was preserved and kept alive by a
group of women, who trimmed and pruned off
many of its rough branches and gave to the
wild native fruit a delicacy and fragrance unknown
to it before. English women writers did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
at that time for the English novel what French
women had done in the preceding century for
the French novel; they made it so pure in
thought and expression that Bishop Huet was
able to say of the French romances of the seventeenth
century, "You'll scarce find an expression
or word which may shock chaste ears, or one
single action which may give offence to modesty."</p>

<p>This great change in the English novel was
inaugurated by a young woman ignorant of the
world, whose power lay in her innocent and
lively imagination. At his home in Queen
Square and later in St. Martin's Street, Charles
Burney, the father of Frances, entertained the
most illustrious men of his day. Johnson,
Reynolds, Garrick, Burke, and Colman were
frequent guests, while members of the nobility
thronged his parlours to listen to the famous
Italian singers who gladly sang for the author of
the <i>History of Music</i>. Here Fanny, a bashful
but observant child, saw life in the drawing-room.
But as Dr. Burney gave little heed to
the comings and goings of his daughters, they
played with the children of a wigmaker next
door, where, perhaps, Fanny became acquainted
with the vulgar side of London life, which is so
humorously depicted in <i>Evelina</i>. She received
but little education, nor was she more than a
casual reader, but she was familiar with <i>Pamela</i>,
<i>Betsey Thoughtless</i>, <i>Rasselas</i>, and the <i>Vicar of Wakefield</i>.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
Such was her preparation for becoming
a writer of novels.</p>

<p>From her earliest years, she had delighted
in writing stories and dramas, although she
received little encouragement in this occupation.
In her fifteenth year her stepmother
proved to her so conclusively the folly of
girls' scribbling that Fanny burned all her
manuscripts, including <i>The History of Caroline
Evelyn</i>. She could not, however, banish from
her mind the fate of Caroline's infant daughter,
born of high rank, but related through her
grandmother to the vulgar people of the East
End of London. The many embarrassing situations
in which she might be placed haunted the
imagination of the youthful writer, but it was
not until her twenty-sixth year that these situations
were described, when <i>Evelina or a Young
Lady's Entrance into the World</i> was published.</p>

<p>The success of the book was instantaneous.
The name of the author, which had been withheld
even from the publishers, was eagerly
demanded. All agreed that only a man conversant
with the world could have written
such accurate descriptions of life both high and
low. The wonder was increased when it was
learned that the author was a young woman
who had drawn her scenes, not from a knowledge
of the world, but from her own intuition and
imagination. Miss Burney became at once<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
an honoured member of the literary circle which
Mrs. Thrale had gathered at Streatham, and a
favourite of Dr. Johnson, who declared that
<i>Evelina</i> was superior to anything that Fielding
had written, and that some passages were
worthy of the pen of Richardson. The book
was accorded a place among English classics,
which it has retained for over a century. "It
was not hard fagging that produced such a
work as <i>Evelina</i>," wrote Mr. Crisp to the youthful
author. "It was the ebullition of true sterling
genius&mdash;you wrote it because you could not help
it&mdash;it came&mdash;and so you put it down on paper."</p>

<p>The novel, following the form so common
in the eighteenth century, is written in the form
of letters. The plot is somewhat time-honoured;
there is the nurse's daughter substituted for the
real heiress, and a mystery surrounding some
of the characters; it is unfolded slowly with
a slight strain upon the readers' credulity at
the last, but it ends to the satisfaction of all
concerned. In many incidents and in some of the
characters the story suggests <i>Betsey Thoughtless</i>,
but Miss Burney had greater powers of description
than Mrs. Haywood.</p>

<p>The plot of the novel is forgotten, however, in
the lively, witty manner in which the characters
are drawn and the ludicrous situations in which
they are placed. So long had these men and
women held the mind of the author that they are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
intensely real as they are presented to us at
assemblies, balls, theatres, and operas, where we
watch their oddities with amusement.</p>

<p>Indeed no woman has given so many graphic,
droll, and minute descriptions of life as Miss
Burney. Her genius in this respect is different
from that of other women novelists. She has
made a series of snap-shots of people in the most
absurd situations and ridicules them while she is
taking the picture. Few women writers can
resist the temptation of peeping into the hearts
of their men and women, and the knowledge
thus gained gives them sympathy, while it often
detracts from the strong lines of the external
picture; a writer will not paint a villain quite
so black if he believes he still preserves some
remnants of a noble nature. But Miss Burney
has no interest in the inner life of her men and
women. She saw their peculiarities and was
amused by them, and has presented them to the
reader with minute descriptions and lively wit.</p>

<p>She also makes fine distinctions between people.
Sir Clement Willoughby, the West End
snob, and Mr. Smith, the East End beau, are
drawn with discrimination. With what wit
Miss Burney describes the scene at the <i>ridotto</i>
between Evelina and Sir Clement. He had
asked her to dance with him. Unwilling to do so,
because she wished to dance with another gentleman,
if he should ask her, she told Sir Clement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
she was engaged for that dance. He did not
leave her, however, but remained by her side
and speculated as to who the beast was so
hostile to his own interests as to forget to come
to her; pitied the humiliation a lady must feel
in having to wait for a gentleman, and pointed
to each old and lame man in the room asking
if he were the miscreant; he offered to find him
for her and asked what kind of a coat he had on.
When Evelina did not know, he became angry
with the wretch who dared to address a lady
in so insignificant a coat that it was unworthy
of her notice. To save herself from further
annoyance she danced with him, for she now
knew that Sir Clement had seen through her
artifice from the beginning.</p>

<p>But the portrait of Mr. Smith, the East End
snob, is even better than that of Sir Clement
Willoughby. Evelina is visiting her relatives
at Snow Hill, when Mr. Smith enters, self-confident
and vulgar. His aim in life, as he
tells us, is to please the ladies. When Tom
Branghton is disputing with his sister about
the place where they shall go for amusement, he
reprimands Tom for his lack of good breeding.</p>

<p>"O fie, Tom,&mdash;dispute with a lady!" cried
Mr. Smith. "Now, as for me, I'm for where
you will, providing this young lady [meaning
Evelina] is of the party; one place is the same
as another to me, so that it be but agreeable to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
the ladies. I would go anywhere with you,
Ma'm, unless, indeed, it were to church;&mdash;ha, ha,
ha, you'll excuse me, Ma'm, but, really, I never
could conquer my fear of a parson;&mdash;ha, ha, ha,&mdash;really,
ladies, I beg your pardon, for being
so rude, but I can't help laughing for my life."</p>

<p>Mr. Smith endeavoured to make himself
particularly pleasing to Evelina, and for that
purpose bought tickets for her and her relatives
to attend the Hampstead Assembly. When he
observed that Evelina was a little out of sorts,
he attributed her low spirits to doubts of his
intentions towards her. "To be sure," he told
her, "marriage is all in all with the ladies; but
with us gentlemen it's quite another thing." He
advised her not to be discouraged, saying with
a patronising air, "You may very well be proud,
for I assure you there is nobody so likely to
catch me at last as yourself."</p>

<p>Both Sir Clement Willoughby and Mr. Smith
are selfish and conceited; but the former had
lived among the gentlemen of Mayfair, the
latter among the tradespeople of Snow Hill, and
this difference of environment is shown in every
speech they utter.</p>

<p>It is the contrast between these two distinct
classes of society that saves the book from
becoming monotonous. Evelina visits the Pantheon
with her West End friends. When Captain
Mirvan wonders what people find in such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
a place, Mr. Lovel, a fashionable fop, quickly
rejoins: "What the ladies may come hither
for, Sir, it would ill become <i>us</i> to determine;
but as to we men, doubtless we can have no
other view, than to admire them." At another
time Evelina visits the opera with the vulgar
Branghtons, who all rejoiced when the curtain
dropped, and Mr. Branghton vowed he would
never be caught again. The Branghtons at the
opera is hardly inferior to Partridge at the play.
Tom Branghton is a good representative of his
class. He describes with glee the last night at
Vauxhall: "There's such squealing and squalling!&mdash;and
then all the lamps are broke,&mdash;and
the women skimper scamper;&mdash;I declare I would
not take five guineas to miss the last night!"</p>

<p>All the characters, even the heroine, take delight,
in boisterous mirth. Much of the humour
of the book consists rather in ludicrous situations
than in any real delicacy of wit. Too often
the laugh is at another's discomfiture, and so
fails to please the present age with its kindlier
feeling towards others. Such are the practical
jokes which Captain Mirvan plays upon Madame
Duval. In one instance, disguised as a robber,
he waylays the lady's coach, and leaves her in a
ditch with her feet tied to a tree. The many
tricks which the doughty Salt plays upon this
lady so much resemble some of the humorous
scenes in <i>Joseph Andrews</i>, and <i>Tom Jones</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
that we may infer the readers of that century
found them laughable. The Captain and the
French woman are two puppets which serve to
introduce much of this horse-play. They are
not even caricatures; they are entirely unlike
anything in human life. With the exception
of these two characters, all the men and women
who provoked the mirth of the heroine are well
portrayed.</p>

<p>Miss Burney is less felicitous in her descriptions
of serious characters. Lord Orville, the same
type of man as Sir Charles Grandison, is true
only in the sense that Miss Burney announces
the truth of the entire book. "I have not pretended
to show the world what it actually <i>is</i>,
but what it <i>appears</i> to a girl of seventeen," she
wrote in the preface to <i>Evelina</i>. Lord Orville,
all dignity, nobility, charm, and perfection, is
but the ideal of a young girl.</p>

<p>Evelina was a new woman in literature, a
revelation to the men of the time of George the
Third. The sincerity of the book could not
be doubted. "But," they asked, "did Evelina
represent the woman's point of view of life?
Surely no man ever held like views." The
Lovelaces and Tom Joneses are not so attractive
as when seen through the eyes of their own
sex, and the heroines are not so soft and yielding
as a man would create them. Evelina, like all
Miss Burney's heroines, is independent, fearless,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
and witty, with scarcely a trace of the traditional
heroine of fiction. Saints and Magdalenes
have always appealed to the masculine
imagination. <i>La donna dolorosa</i> has occupied
a prominent place in the art and literature of
man's creation. Here he has revealed his sex
egoism in all its nudity: the woman weeping
for man, either lover, husband, or son; man the
centre of her thoughts, her hopes and fears.
This new heroine with a new regard towards
man was a revelation to them. Evelina was the
first woman to break the spell, to show them
woman as woman, in lieu of woman as parasite
and adjunct to man. Evelina is not always
pleasing; she hasn't always good manners;
she sometimes laughs in the faces of the dashing
beaux who are addressing her. But she is a
woman of real flesh and blood; such women have
existed in all time, and, liked many women we
meet every day and whom men in all ages have
known, Evelina insists on being the centre of
every scene.</p>

<p>In July, 1782, Miss Burney's second book,
<i>Cecilia, or Memoirs of an Heiress</i>, was published.
This novel met with as enthusiastic a reception as
<i>Evelina</i>. Gibbon read the whole five volumes
in a day; Burke declared they had cost him
three days, though he did not part with the
story from the time he first opened it, and had
sat up a whole night to finish it; and Sir Joshua<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
Reynolds had been fed while reading it, because
he refused to quit it at the table.</p>

<p>The book shows more care and effort than
<i>Evelina</i>. That was an outburst of youthful vivacity
and spirits, but in <i>Cecilia</i> the author
is striving to do her best. This is particularly
revealed in the style, which shows the influence
of Doctor Johnson, for it has lost the simplicity
of <i>Evelina</i>. The diction is more ambitious, and
the sentences are longer, many of them balanced.
Even some of the inferior characters from their
speech, appear to have received a lesson in
English composition from Dr. Johnson.</p>

<p>But the novel owes its place among English
classics to the varieties of characters portrayed
and the vivid pictures of English life. Here
again the gaieties of Vauxhall, Ranelagh, Marylebone
and the Pantheon have become immortal,
drawn with colours as vivid and enduring as
Hogarth used in painting the sadder sides of
London life. No other writer has brought these
places before our eyes as clearly and as fully
as Fanny Burney.</p>

<p>The plot of <i>Cecilia</i>, like that of <i>Evelina</i>, is so
arranged as to present different classes of society.
<i>Cecilia</i> has three guardians, with one of whom she
must live during her minority. First she visits
Mr. Harrel, a gay, fashionable man, a spendthrift
and a gambler, who lives in a fashionable house
in Portman Square, where Cecilia, during a con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>stant
round of festivities, meets the fashionable
people of London. Next she visits Mr. Briggs in
the City, "a short thick, sturdy man, with very
small keen black eyes, a square face, a dark
complexion, and a snub nose." He was so
miserly that when Cecilia asked for pen, ink,
and a sheet of paper, he gave her a slate and
pencil, as he supposed she had nothing of
consequence to say. He was as sparing of
his words as of his money, and used the same
elliptical sentences in his speech as Dickens
afterwards put into the mouth of Alfred Jingle,
the famous character in <i>Pickwick Papers</i>.
He thus advises Cecilia in regard to
her lovers: "Take care of sharpers; don't
trust shoe-buckles, nothing but Bristol stones!
tricks in all things. A fine gentleman sharp
as another man. Never give your heart to
a gold-topped cane, nothing but brass gilt over.
Cheats everywhere: fleece you in a year; won't
leave you a groat. But one way to be safe,&mdash;bring
'em all to me." Lastly she visits Mr.
Delvile, her third guardian, a man of family,
who despised both the men associated with
him as trustees of Cecilia; he lived in such
gloomy state in his magnificent old house
in St. James's Square that it inspired awe,
and repressed all pleasure. Pride in their birth
and prejudice against all parvenus were the
faults of Mr. and Mrs. Delvile.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides these characters, there were many
others whose names were for a long time familiar
in every household. Sir Robert Floyer was
as vain as Mr. Smith. Mr. Meadows was constantly
bored to death; it was insufferable exertion
to talk to a quiet woman, and a talkative one
put him into a fever. At the opera the solos depressed
him and the full orchestra fatigued
him. He yawned while ladies were talking to
him, and after he had begged them to repeat
what they had said, forgot to listen. "I am
tired to death! tired of everything," was his
constant expression.</p>

<p>In his critical essay on Madame D'Arblay,
Fanny Burney's married name, under which
her later works were published, Macaulay has
thus dealt with her treatment of character:</p>

<p>"Madame D'Arblay has left us scarcely anything
but humours. Almost every one of her
men and women has some one propensity
developed to a morbid degree. In <i>Cecilia</i>,
for example, Mr. Delvile never opens his lips
without some allusion to his own birth and
station; or Mr. Briggs without some allusion
to the hoarding of money; or Mr. Hobson,
without betraying the self-indulgence and self-importance
of a purse-proud upstart; or Mr.
Simkins, without uttering some sneaking remark
for the purpose of currying favour with his
customers; or Mr. Meadows, without expressing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
apathy and weariness of life; or Mr. Albany,
without declaiming about the vices of the rich
and the misery of the poor; or Mrs. Belfield,
without some indelicate eulogy on her son;
or Lady Margaret, without indicating jealousy
of her husband. Morrice is all skipping, officious
impertinence, Mr. Gosport all sarcasm, Lady
Honoria all lively prattle, Miss Larolles all silly
prattle; if ever Madame D'Arblay aimed at
more, as in the character of Monckton, we do
not think that she succeeded well.... The
variety of humours which is to be found in her
novels is immense; and though the talk of each
person separately is monotonous, the general
effect is not monotony, but a most lively and
agreeable diversity."</p>

<p>While the character of Monckton is not strongly
drawn, one or two scenes in which he figures
have great power. Mr. Monckton, who had
married an aged woman for her money, lived in
constant hope of her dissolution. He planned
to keep Cecilia from marrying until that happy
event, when he schemed to make her his bride,
and thus acquire a second fortune. He had
used his influence as a family friend to prejudice
her lovers in her eyes, and had just succeeded
in breaking up an intimacy which he feared:
"A weight was removed from his mind which
had nearly borne down even his remotest hopes;
the object of his eager pursuit seemed still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
within his reach, and the rival into whose power
he had so lately almost beheld her delivered, was
totally renounced, and no longer to be dreaded.
A revolution such as this, raised expectations
more sanguine than ever; and in quitting the
house, he exultingly considered himself released
from every obstacle to his view,&mdash;till, just as he
arrived home, he recollected his wife!"</p>

<p>Cecilia, the heroine of the novel, is only
Evelina grown a little older, a little sadder, a
little more worldly wise. The humour is, too, a
little kindlier. The practical jokes so common
in <i>Evelina</i> do not mar the pages of <i>Cecilia</i>.
At times the latter novel becomes almost tragic.
The scene at Vauxhall where Mr. Harrel puts
an end to his life of dissipation is dramatic and
thrilling. But Miss Burney had lost the buoyancy
and lively fancy which made the charm of
<i>Evelina</i>.</p>

<p>Miss Burney's last two novels, <i>Camilla, or a
Picture of Youth</i> and <i>The Wanderer, or Female
Difficulties</i>, have no claim to a place among
English classics. It is strange that, as she saw
more of life, she depicted it with less accuracy.
This might seem to show that her first novels owe
their excellence to her vivid imagination rather
than to her powers of observation. Her weary
life at court as second keeper of the robes
to Queen Charlotte; her marriage to Monsieur
D'Arblay, and the sorrows that came to her as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
the wife of a French refugee; all her deeper
experiences of life during the fourteen years between
the publication of <i>Cecilia</i> and <i>Camilla</i>&mdash;these
had completely changed her light, humorous
view of externals, and with that loss her
power as an artist disappeared.</p>

<p><i>Camilla</i> has several heroines whose love
affairs interest the reader. It thus bears a
resemblance to Miss Austen's novels, who speaks
of it with admiration and was, perhaps, influenced
by it. Eugenia, who has received the
education of a man, is pleasing. Clermont
Lynmere, like Mr. Smith and Sir Robert Floyer,
imagines that all the ladies are in love with him.
Sir Hugh Tyrold, with his love for the classics
and his regret that he had not been beaten into
learning them when he was a boy, his strict
ideas of virtue and his desire to make everybody
happy, is well conceived, but the outlines are not
strong enough to make him a living character.
<i>Camilla</i> shows more than <i>Cecilia</i> the style of
Dr. Johnson. It is heavy and slow, the words
are long, and many of them of Latin derivation.</p>

<p>It was not until the year 1814, the year of
<i>Waverley</i>, that her last novel, <i>The Wanderer,
or Female Difficulties</i>, was published, which,
following the style of <i>Camilla</i>, was in five volumes.
It was partly founded on incidents arising
out of the French Revolution. The book
was eagerly awaited; the publishers paid fifteen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
hundred guineas for it; but even the friendliest
critic pronounced it a literary failure.</p>

<p>To sum up, Macaulay in the essay before
quoted makes clear Miss Burney's place in
fiction:</p>

<p>"Miss Burney did for the English novel
what Jeremy Collier did for the English drama;
and she did it in a better way. She first showed
that a tale might be written in which both the
fashionable and the vulgar life of London might
be exhibited with great force and with broad
comic humour, and which yet should not contain
a single line inconsistent with rigid morality,
or even with virgin delicacy. She took away the
reproach which lay on a most useful and delightful
species of composition. She vindicated the
right of her sex to an equal share in a fair and
noble province of letters ... we owe to her
not only <i>Evelina</i>, <i>Cecilia</i>, and <i>Camilla</i>, but also
<i>Mansfield Park</i> and <i>The Absentee</i>."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<h2>Hannah More</h2>


<p>During the time that Dr. Johnson dominated
the literary conscience of England,
a group of ladies who had wearied of whist and
quadrille, the common amusements of fashion,
used to meet at the homes of one another to discuss
literary and political subjects. They were
called in ridicule the "Blue Stocking Club," because
Mr. Benjamin Stillingfleet, who was always
present at these gatherings, wore hose of that
colour. Among the members distinguished by
their wit and talents were Mrs. Elizabeth Montagu,
the author of an <i>Essay on the Genius of
Shakespeare</i>; Mrs. Elizabeth Carter, a poetess
and excellent Greek scholar; Mrs. Chapone, whose
<i>Letters to Young Ladies</i> formed the standard
of conduct for young women of two generations;
Miss Reynolds, the sister of Sir Joshua; and
Mrs. Vesey, noted as a charming hostess. Dr.
Johnson, David Garrick, Reynolds, and Burke
were frequenters of this club. One may well
imagine that the conversation and wit of the Blue<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
Stockings were far too rare to be understood
by the grosser minds of the mere devotees of
fashion, who in consequence threw a ridicule
upon them which has always adhered to the
name.</p>

<p>Hannah More, who had already become known
as a playwright, visited London in 1773, and
at once was welcomed by this group. In a
poem called <i>The Bas Bleu</i>, dedicated to Mrs.
Vesey, she thus describes the pleasure of these
meetings:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Enlighten'd spirits! You, who know</span><br />
What charms from polish'd converse flow,<br />
Speak, for you can, the pure delight<br />
When kindling sympathies unite;<br />
When correspondent tastes impart<br />
Communion sweet from heart to heart;<br />
You ne'er the cold gradations need<br />
Which vulgar souls to union lead;<br />
No dry discussion to unfold<br />
The meaning caught ere well 't is told:<br />
In taste, in learning, wit, or science,<br />
Still kindled souls demand alliance:<br />
Each in the other joys to find<br />
The image answering to his mind.<br />
</p></div>

<p>The Blue Stocking Club was composed largely
of Tories, so that when all Europe became
restless under the influence of the French
Revolution, they strongly combated the levelling
doctrines of democracy. Hannah More in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
particular, who had been conducting schools for
the very poor near Bristol, saw how the teachings
of the revolutionists affected men already prone
to idleness and drink. To offset these influences,
she published a little book with the following
title-page: "Village Politics. Addressed to
all the Mechanics, Journeymen, and Labourers,
in Great Britain. By Will Chip, a country
Carpenter."</p>

<p>It is not a novel in the strict sense of the word,
but in simple language, easily understood, it
teaches the labouring people the inconsistent
attitude of France, and the strength and safety
of the English constitution. It is not a deep
book, but has good work-a-day common-sense,
such as keeps the world jogging on, ready to endure
the ills it has rather than fly to others it
knows not of.</p>

<p>The book is in the form of a dialogue between
Jack Anvil, the blacksmith, and Tom Hood,
the mason.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Tom.</span> But have you read the <i>Rights of
Man</i>?</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Jack.</span> No, not I: I had rather by half read
the <i>Whole Duty of Man</i>. I have but little time
for reading, and such as I should therefore
only read a bit of the best."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"<span class="smcap">Tom.</span> And what dost thou take a <i>democrat</i>
to be?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Jack.</span> One who likes to be governed by a
thousand tyrants, and yet can't bear a king."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"<span class="smcap">Tom.</span> What is it to be <i>an enlightened people</i>?</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Jack.</span> To put out the light of the Gospel,
confound right and wrong, and grope about in
pitch darkness."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"<span class="smcap">Tom.</span> And what is <i>benevolence</i>?</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Jack.</span> Why, in the new-fangled language,
it means contempt of religion, aversion to
justice, overturning of law, doating on all
mankind in general, and hating everybody in
particular."</p>

<p>For a long time the authorship of the book
remained a secret, and Will Chip became a
notable figure. The clergy and the land-owners
in particular rejoiced over his homely common-sense,
and distributed these pamphlets broadcast
over the land. One hundred thousand
copies were sold in a short time. <i>Village Politics</i>
is said to have been one of the strongest
influences in England to awaken the common
people to the dangers which lie in a sudden
overthrow of government. The book was
timely, for that decade had become intoxicated
by the name of Liberty. To-day democracy and
equality are no longer feared.</p>

<p>During many years Hannah More worked
industriously among the poor of Cheddar and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
its vicinity. On a visit to the Cliffs of Cheddar
she found an ignorant, half-savage people,
many of whom dwelt in the caves and fissures
of the rocks, and earned a miserable subsistence
by selling stalactites and other minerals native
to the place, to the travellers who were attracted
thither by the beautiful scenery. Among these
people Hannah More opened a Sunday-school,
and later a day school, where the girls were
taught knitting, spinning, and sewing. A girl
trained in her school was presented on her
marriage day with five shillings, a pair of white
stockings, and a new Bible. The teaching in
the schools was so practical that within a year
schools were opened in nine parishes.</p>

<p>In this missionary work, Miss More became
intimately acquainted not only with the very
poor, but also with the rich farmers living in the
neighbourhood and the prosperous tradespeople
of the villages. From these better educated
men she met with great opposition. One petty
landlord met her request for assistance with the
remark: "The lower classes are fated to be poor,
ignorant and wicked; and wise as you are, you
cannot alter what is decreed." Another man
informed her that religion was the worst thing
for the poor, it made them so lazy and useless.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>But the minds of the people had been awakened
by the French Revolution. They were begin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>ning
to think. Books and ballads attacking
church and constitution were hawked through
the country and placed within reach of all.
To counteract the influence of these "corrupt
and inflammatory publications" Hannah More,
between the years 1795-1798, published <i>The
Cheap Repository</i>, the first regular issue of this
kind. Every month a story, a ballad, and a
tract for Sunday were published. Hannah More
knew so well the common reasoning and the
mental attitude of those for whom she wrote,
that she was able to make her lessons most
effective. So great was the demand for these
chap-books that over two million were sold
the first year.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> For a complete bibliography of these chap-books,
see the <i>Catalogue of English and American Chap-Books</i>
in Harvard College Library, pp. 8-10; compiled in part
by Charles Welsh.</p></div>

<p>These stories were divided into two classes,
those for "persons of middle rank" and those
for the common people. The former point out
the dangers of pride and covetousness; of substituting
abstract philosophy for religion; and
warn masters not to forget their moral obligations
towards their servants. The latter aim to
teach neatness, sobriety, regularity in church
attendance, and point out the happiness of those
who follow these precepts, and the misery of
those who neglect them.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>Her
two best known stories are <i>Mr. Fantom</i>
and <i>The Shepherd of Salisbury Plain</i>. <i>Mr.
Fantom: or the History of the New-Fashioned
Philosopher, and his Man William</i> was written
to warn masters of the danger of teaching their
servants disrespect for the Bible and for civil
law. Mr. Fantom was a shallow man, who glided
upon the surface of philosophy and culled those
precepts which relieved his conscience from any
moral obligations. When he was asked to
help the poor in his own parish, he refused to
consider their wants because his mind was so
engrossed by the partition of Poland. Like
Mrs. Jellyby of a later time, he was so much
troubled by sufferings which he could not see
that he neglected his family and servants.
When he reprimanded his butler, William, for
being intoxicated, the young man replied:
"Why, sir, you are a philosopher, you know;
and I have often overheard you say to your
company, that private vices are public benefits;
and so I thought that getting drunk was as
pleasant a way of doing good to the public as
any, especially when I could oblige my muster
at the same time." In course of time William
became a thief and a murderer, and expiated
his crimes on the scaffold.</p>

<p>In contrast to this is <i>The Shepherd of Salisbury
Plain</i>. This shepherd was contented with
his lot, and says: "David was happier when he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
kept his father's sheep on such a plain as this,
and employed in singing some of his own psalms
perhaps, than ever he was when he became
king of Israel and Judah. And I dare say
we should never have had some of the most
beautiful texts in all those fine psalms, if he
had not been a shepherd, which enabled him to
make so many fine comparisons and similitudes,
as one may say, from country life, flocks of
sheep, hills and valleys, fields of corn, and
fountains of water." The shepherd's neat cottage
with its simple furnishings, his frugal
wife and industrious children are described in
simple and convincing language.</p>

<p>In the stories of the poor there are many
interesting details of the everyday life of that
class that did not blossom into heroes and
heroines of romance for nearly half a century.
Mrs. Sponge, in <i>The History of Betty Brown,
the St. Giles's Orange Girl</i>, is a character that
Dickens might have immortalised. Mrs. Sponge
kept a little shop and a kind of eating-house for
poor girls near the Seven Dials. She received
stolen goods, and made such large profits in her
business that she was enabled to become a
broker among the poor. She loaned Betty five
shillings to set her up in the orange business;
she did not ask for the return of her money, but
exacted a sixpence a day for its use, and was
regarded by Betty, and the other girls whom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
she thus befriended, as a benefactor. At last,
Betty was rescued from the clutches of Mrs.
Sponge. By industry and piety she became
mistress of a handsome sausage-shop near the
Seven Dials, and married a hackney coachman,
the hero of one of Miss More's ballads:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
I am a bold coachman, and drive a good hack<br />
With a coat of five capes that quite covers my back;<br />
And my wife keeps a sausage-shop, not many miles<br />
From the narrowest alley in all broad St. Giles.<br />
Though poor, we are honest and very content,<br />
We pay as we go, for meat, drink, and for rent;<br />
To work all the week I am able and willing,<br />
I never get drunk, and I waste not a shilling;<br />
And while at a tavern my gentleman tarries,<br />
The coachman grows richer than he whom he carries,<br />
And I'd rather (said I), since it saves me from sin,<br />
Be the driver without, than the toper within.<br />
</p></div>

<p><i>The Cheap Repository</i> was written to teach
moral precepts. Neither Hannah More nor her
readers saw any artistic beauty in the sordid
lives of this lower stratum of society. They
were not interested in the superstitions of
"Poor Sally Evans," who hung a plant called
"midsummer-men" in her room on Midsummer
eve so that she might learn by the bending of
the leaves if her lover were true to her, and who
consulted all the fortune-tellers that came to her
door to learn whether the two moles on her
cheek foretold two husbands or two children.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
Hannah More recorded these simple fancies of
poor Sally only to show her folly and the misfortunes
that afterwards befell her on account
of her superstitions. Writers of that century
either laughed at the ignorant blunders of the
poor, or used them to point a moral. An interest
in them because they are human beings like
ourselves with common frailties belongs to the
next century. Nothing proves more conclusively
the growth of the democratic idea than
the changed attitude of the novel toward the
ignorant and the criminal.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Hannah More was always interested in the
education of young ladies. She wrote a series
of essays called <i>Strictures on the Modern
System of Female Education</i>, in which she
protested loudly against the tendency to give
girls an ornamental rather than a useful education.
This was so highly approved that she was
asked to make suggestions for the education of
the Princess Charlotte. This led to her writing
<i>Hints towards Forming the Character of a Young
Princess</i>.</p>

<p>Hannah More finally embodied her theories on
the education of women in a book which she
thought might appeal most strongly to the young
ladies themselves, <i>C&#339;lebs in Search of a Wife</i>.
Running through it, is a slight romance. C&#339;lebs,
filled with admiration for Eve, as described<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
in <i>Paradise Lost</i>, where she is intent on her
household duties, goes forth into the world to
find, if possible, such a helpmate for himself.
As he meets different women, he compares
them with his ideal, and, finding them lacking,
passes a severe criticism upon female education
and accomplishments. Finally, he meets a
lady with well-trained mind, who delights in
works of charity and piety, one well calculated
to conduct wisely the affairs of his household.
She has besides proper humility, and accepts with
gratitude the honour of becoming C&#339;lebs's wife.</p>

<p>Until her death at the advanced age of eighty-eight
years, Hannah More continued to write
moral and religious essays, so that she was before
the public view for over fifty years, Mrs.
S. C. Hall in her book <i>Pilgrimages to English
Shrines</i> thus describes her in old age:</p>

<p>"Hannah More wore a dress of very light
green silk&mdash;a white China crape shawl was
folded over her shoulders; her white hair was
frizzled, after a by-gone fashion, above her brow,
and that <i>backed</i>, as it were, by a very full double
border of rich lace. The reality was as dissimilar
from the picture painted by our imagination as
anything could well be; such a sparkling, light,
bright, 'summery'-looking old lady&mdash;more like
a beneficent fairy, than the biting author of
<i>Mr. Fantom</i>, though in perfect harmony with
<i>The Shepherd of Salisbury Plain</i>."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>

<h2>Charlotte Smith. Mrs. Inchbald</h2>


<p>While Hannah More was endeavouring
to improve the condition of the poor
by teaching them diligence and sobriety, a group
of earnest men and women were writing books
and pamphlets in which they claimed that poverty
and ignorance were due to unjust laws.
The writings of Voltaire and Rousseau had
filled their minds with bright pictures of a
democracy. These theories were considered most
dangerous in England, but they were the theories
which helped to shape the American
constitution. Among these English revolutionists
were William Godwin, Mary Wollstonecraft,
Charlotte Smith, Mrs. Inchbald, and for a time
Amelia Opie.</p>

<p>The strongest political novel was <i>Caleb Williams</i>
by William Godwin. In this he shows
how through law man may become the destroyer
of man. This interest in the rights of
man awakened interest in the condition of women;
and Mary Wollstonecraft, who afterward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
became Mrs. Godwin, wrote <i>Vindication of the
Rights of Woman</i>. This pamphlet was declared
contrary to the Bible and to Christian law,
although all its demands have now been conceded.
Charlotte Smith was also interested in
the position of women and the laws affecting
them. In <i>Desmond</i> she discussed freely a
marriage problem which in her day seemed
very bold, while in her private life she ignored
British prejudices.</p>

<p>She was the mother of twelve children and
the wife of a man of many schemes, so that
she was continually devising ways to extricate
her large family from the financial difficulties
into which he plunged them. At one time a friend
suggested to her that her husband's attention
should be turned toward religion. Her reply
was: "Oh, for heaven's sake, do not put it into
his head to take to religion, for if he does, he
will instantly begin by building a cathedral."
She is supposed to have caricatured him in the
projector who hoped to make a fortune by
manuring his estate with old wigs. But when
her husband was imprisoned for debt, she
shared his captivity, and began to write to support
her family. Although she died at the
age of fifty-seven, she found time during her
manifold cares to write thirty-eight volumes.</p>

<p>But not only did Mrs. Smith endure sorrows
as great as those of her favourite heroine, Sidney<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
Biddulph, but one of her daughters was equally
unfortunate. She was married unhappily, and
returned with her three children for her mother
to support. Mr. and Mrs. Smith, after twenty-three
years of married life, agreed to live in
separate countries, he in Normandy, and she in
England, although they always corresponded
and were interested in each other's welfare.
Yet this separation, together with the revolutionary
tendencies discovered in her writings,
raised a storm of criticism against her.</p>

<p>In <i>Desmond</i>, which was regarded as so dangerous,
Mrs. Smith has presented the following
problem: Geraldine, the heroine, is married to a
spendthrift, who attempts to retrieve his fortunes
by forcing his wife to become the mistress
of his friend, the rich Duc de Romagnecourt.
To preserve her honour she leaves him, hoping
to return to her mother's roof; but her mother
refuses to receive her and bids her return to her
husband. As she dares not do this, and is without
money, a faithful friend, Desmond, takes her
under his protection, asking no reward but the
pleasure of serving her. Finally Geraldine receives
a letter informing her that her husband
is ill. She returns to him, and nurses him until
he dies; after a year of mourning she marries
Desmond.</p>

<p>How could a woman have behaved more
virtuously than Geraldine? She is always high-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>minded
and actuated by the purest motives.
But it was feared that her example might encourage
wives to desert their husbands, and
consequently the novel was declared immoral.</p>

<p><i>Desmond</i> was published in 1792, when the
feeling against France was very bitter in England.
The plot, as it meanders slowly through three
volumes, is constantly interrupted by political
discussions. The author's clearly expressed
preference for a republican government, and her
criticism of English law, met with bitter disapproval.
One of the characters pronounces
a panegyric upon the greater prosperity and
happiness that has come to the French soldiers,
farmers, and peasants, since they came to believe
that they were sharers in their own labours,
and the hero of the book, writing from France
to a friend in England, says: "I lament still
more the disposition which too many Englishmen
show to join in this unjust and infamous
crusade, against the holy standard of freedom;
and I blush for my country." In the same
book, the author censures the penal laws of
England, by which robbery to the amount of
forty shillings is punishable with death; and
criticises the delay of the courts in dealing
justice.</p>

<p>This criticism is expressed tamely, barely
more than suggested, when compared with the
vigorous attacks which Dickens made in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
next century on English law and the slow action
of justice in the famous "Circumlocution Office."
Dickens wrote with such vigour that he brought
about a reform. A modern reader finds <i>Desmond</i>
earnest and sincere, but tame to the point of
dulness. It seems strange how the Tory party
could see in this book a menace to the British
constitution. But a writer in the <i>Monthly
Review</i> for December, 1792, advocated her cause.
"She is very justly of opinion," he writes,
"that the great events that are passing in the
world are no less interesting to women than
to men, and that, in her solicitude to discharge
the domestic duties, a woman ought not to
forget that, in common with her father and
husband, her brothers and sons, she is a citizen."</p>

<p>The publication of <i>The Old Manor House</i> in
the following year won back for her many of
the friends that she had lost by <i>Desmond</i>. But in
this work also the same love of liberty, the same
indifference to social distinctions, occur. The
hero of <i>The Old Manor House</i> joins the English
army, and is sent to fight against the Americans;
in the many reflections upon this conflict, the
author shows that her sympathies are with the
colonists. The father of the hero had married a
young woman who had nothing to recommend
her but "beauty, simplicity, and goodness."
The hero himself falls in love with and marries
a girl beneath him in rank, but he does not seem<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
to feel that he has done a generous thing, nor
does the heroine show any gratitude for this
honour. Each seems unconscious that their
difference in rank should be a bar to their union,
provided they do not offend old Mrs. Rayland,
the owner of the manor. A great change had
come over the novel since Pamela was overpowered
with gratitude to her profligate master,
Mr. B, for condescending to make her his wife.</p>

<p>The revolutionary principles of Mrs. Smith's
novels were soon forgotten, but two new
elements were introduced by her that bore fruit
in English fiction. Her great gift to the novel
was the portrayal of refined, quiet, intellectual
ladies, beside whom Evelina and Cecilia seem
but school-girls. Her heroines may be poor,
they may be of inferior rank, but they are
always ladies of sensitive nature and cultivated
manners, and are drawn with a feeling and
tenderness which no novelist before her had
reached. A contemporary said of Emmeline,
"All is graceful, and pleasing to the sight, all,
in short, is simple, femininely beautiful and
chaste." This might be said of all the women
she has created. Old Mrs. Rayland, the central
personage in her most popular novel, <i>The Old
Manor House</i>, notwithstanding her exalted ideas
of her own importance as a member of the
Rayland family, and the arbitrary manner in
which she compels all to conform to her old-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>fashioned
notions, is always the high-born lady.
We smile at her, but she never forfeits our
respect. Scott said of her, "Old Mrs. Rayland
is without a peer."</p>

<p>Mrs. Smith's second gift to the novel was her
charming descriptions of rural scenery. Nature
had for a long time been banished from the arts.
Wordsworth in one of his prefaces wrote:</p>

<p>"Excepting <i>The Nocturnal Reverie</i> of Lady
Winchelsea, and a passage or two in the <i>Windsor
Forest</i> of Pope, the poetry of the period intervening
between the publication of <i>Paradise Lost</i>
and <i>The Seasons</i> does not contain a single new
image of external nature; and scarcely presents
a familiar one, from which it can be inferred
that the eye of the Poet had been steadily fixed
upon his object, much less that his feelings had
urged him to work upon it in the spirit of
genuine imagination."</p>

<p>Fiction was as barren of scenery as poetry.
None of the novelists were cognisant of the
country scenes amid which their plots were laid,
with the possible exception of Goldsmith.
<i>The Vicar of Wakefield</i> has a rural setting, and
there are references to the trees, the blackbirds,
and the hayfields; but description is not introduced
for the sake of its own beauty as in the
novels of Charlotte Smith. In <i>Ethelinda</i> there
are beautiful descriptions of the English Lakes,
part of the scene being laid at Grasmere;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
<i>Celestina</i> is in the romantic Provence; <i>Desmond</i>
in Normandy; and in <i>The Old Manor House</i>
we have the soft landscape of the south of
England.</p>

<p>In <i>The Old Manor House</i> she thus describes
one of the paths that led from the gate of the
park to Rayland Hall:</p>

<p>"The other path, which in winter or in wet
seasons was inconvenient, wound down a declivity,
where furze and fern were shaded by
a few old hawthorns and self-sown firs: out of
the hill several streams were filtered, which,
uniting at its foot, formed a large and clear
pond of near twenty acres, fed by several imperceptible
currents from other eminences which
sheltered that side of the park; and the bason
between the hills and the higher parts of it
being thus filled, the water found its way over
a stony boundary, where it was passable by a
foot bridge unless in time of floods; and from
thence fell into a lower part of the ground,
where it formed a considerable river; and,
winding among willows and poplars for near
a mile, again spread into a still larger lake, on the
edge of which was a mill, and opposite, without
the park paling, wild heaths, where the ground
was sandy, broken, and irregular, still however
marked by plantations made in it by the
Rayland family."</p>

<p>Every feature of the landscape is brought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
distinctly before the eye. Such descriptions
are not unusual now, but they were first used
by Charlotte Smith.</p>

<p>Even more realistic is the picture of a road
in a part of the New Forest near Christchurch:</p>

<p>"It was a deep, hollow road, only wide enough
for waggons, and was in some places shaded by
hazel and other brush wood; in others, by old
beech and oaks, whose roots wreathed about the
bank, intermingled with ivy, holly, and evergreen
fern, almost the only plants that appeared
in a state of vegetation, unless the pale and
sallow mistletoe, which here and there partially
tinted with faint green the old trees above
them.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"Everything was perfectly still around; even
the robin, solitary songster of the frozen woods,
had ceased his faint vespers to the setting sun,
and hardly a breath of air agitated the leafless
branches. This dead silence was interrupted by
no sound but the slow progress of his horse, as the
hollow ground beneath his feet sounded as if he
trod on vaults. There was in the scene, and in
this dull pause of nature, a solemnity not unpleasant
to Orlando, in his present disposition
of mind."</p>

<p>In 1842, Miss Mitford wrote to Miss Barrett:
"Charlotte Smith's works, with all their faults,
have yet a love of external nature, and a power<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
of describing it, which I never take a spring walk
without feeling." And again she wrote to a
friend referring to Mrs. Smith, "Except that
they want cheerfulness, nothing can exceed the
beauty of the style."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The life and writings of Mrs. Inchbald had
some things in common with the life and writings
of Mrs. Smith. Both were obliged to write to
support themselves as well as those dependent
upon them. Both had seen many phases of
human nature, and both viewed with scorn the
pretensions of the rich and beheld with pity the
sorrows of the poor. Both were champions of
social and political equality. Mrs. Inchbald,
however, was an actress and a successful playwright,
hence her novels are the more dramatic,
but they lack the beautiful rural setting which
gives a poetic atmosphere to the writings of
Charlotte Smith.</p>

<p><i>A Simple Story</i>, the first, of Mrs. Inchbald's
two novels, has been called the precursor of <i>Jane
Eyre</i>. It is the first novel in which we are more
interested in what is felt than in what actually
happens. Mr. Dorriforth, a Catholic priest, and
Miss Milner, his ward, fall in love with each
other, and we watch this hidden passion, which
preys upon the health of both. He is horrified
that he has broken his vows; she is mortified
that she loves a man who, she believes, neither<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
can nor does return her feeling for him. When
he is released from his vow, it is the emotion,
not external happenings, that holds the interest.
The first part of the story is brought to a close
with the marriage of Mr. Dorriforth, now Lord
Elmwood, and Miss Milner.</p>

<p>Seventeen years elapse between the two
halves of the novel. During this time trouble
has come between them and they have separated.
The character of each has undergone a change.
Traits of disposition that were first but lightly
observed have been intensified with years.
Mrs. Inchbald writes of the hero: "Dorriforth,
the pious, the good, the tender Dorriforth, is
become a hard-hearted tyrant; the compassionate,
the feeling, the just Lord Elmwood,
an example of implacable rigour and justice."
His friend Sandford has also changed with the
years, but he has been softened, not hardened
by them&mdash;"the reprover, the enemy of the
vain, the idle, and the wicked, but the friend
and comforter of the forlorn and miserable."</p>

<p>The story of Dorriforth gives unity to the
two parts of the novel. The conflict between his
love and his anger holds the reader in suspense
until the conclusion. The characters of eighteenth-century
fiction were actuated by but a
small number of motives. In nearly all the
novels the men were either generous and free
or stingy and hypocritical; the women were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
either virtuous and winsome, or immoral and
brazen. Mrs. Inchbald possessed, only in a
less degree, George Eliot's power of character-analysis;
she observed minor qualities, and
she was as unflinching in following the development
of evil traits to a tragic conclusion as was
the author of <i>Adam Bede</i>.</p>

<p>In <i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i> for March,
1791, some one wrote of <i>A Simple Story</i>:</p>

<p>"She has struck out a path entirely her own.
She has disdained to follow the steps of her
predecessors, and to construct a new novel,
as is too commonly done, out of the scraps and
fragments of earlier inventors. Her principal
character, the Roman Catholic lord, is perfectly
new: and she has conducted him, through a
series of surprising well-contrasted adventures,
with an uniformity of character and truth of
description that have rarely been surpassed."</p>

<p>There is, however, one hackneyed scene. A
young girl is seized, thrust into a chariot, and
carried at full speed to a lonely place. There
is hardly an early novel where this bald incident
is not worked up into one or more chapters, with
variations to suit the convenience of the plot.
It was as much a part of the stock in trade of
the novelist of the eighteenth century as a
family quarrel is of the twentieth. With this
exception, <i>A Simple Story</i> is new in its plot,
incidents, characters, and mode of treatment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
Emotion did not play so important a part in a
novel again until Charlotte Bront&euml; wrote <i>Jane
Eyre</i>.</p>

<p>Mrs. Inchbald's only other novel, <i>Nature and
Art</i>, shows the artificialities of society. Two
cousins, William and Henry, are contrasted.
William is the son of a dean. Henry's father
went to Africa to live, whence he sent his son
to his rich uncle to be educated. Henry fails
to comprehend the society in which he finds
himself placed, and cannot understand that
there should be any poor people.</p>

<p>"'Why, here is provision enough for all the
people,' said Henry; 'why should they want?
why do not they go and take some of these
things?'</p>

<p>"'They must not,' said the dean, 'unless they
were their own.'</p>

<p>"'What, Uncle! Does no part of the earth,
nor anything which the earth produces, belong
to the poor?'"</p>

<p>His uncle fails to answer this question to his
nephew's satisfaction.</p>

<p>The vices and the fawning duplicity of William
are contrasted with the virtues and independent
spirit of Henry.</p>

<p>"'I know I am called proud,' one day said
William to Henry.</p>

<p>"'Dear Cousin,' replied Henry, 'it must be
only then by those who do not know you; for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
to me you appear the humblest creature in the
world.'</p>

<p>"'Do you really think so?'</p>

<p>"'I am certain of it; or would you always give
up your opinion to that of persons in a superior
state, however inferior in their understanding?
... I have more pride than you, for I will
never stoop to act or to speak contrary to my
feelings.'"</p>

<p>William rises to eminence, in time becoming
a judge. Henry, who is always virtuous, can
obtain no preferment. This contrast in the two
cousins is not so overdrawn as at first appears.
William represents the aristocracy of the old
world; Henry, the free representative of a new
country.</p>

<p>A tragic story runs through the novel, which
becomes intensely dramatic at the point where
William puts on his black cap to pronounce sentence
on the girl whom he had ruined years
before. He does not recognise her; but she,
who had loved him through the years, becomes
insane, not at the thought of death, but that
he should be the one to pronounce the sentence.
It is doubtful if any novelist before Scott had
produced so thrilling a situation, a situation
which grew naturally out of the plot, and the
anguish of the poor unfortunate Agnes has the
realism of Thomas Hardy or Tolstoi.</p>

<p>Only by reading these old novels can one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
comprehend the change produced in England
by the next half-century. The teachings of Mrs.
Charlotte Smith and Mrs. Inchbald were declared
dangerous to the state. That they taught disrespect
for authority, was one of the many charges
brought against them. Yet with what ladylike
reserve they advance views which a later generation
applauded when boldly proclaimed by
Dickens, Thackeray, and Disraeli!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<h2>Clara Reeve. Ann Radcliffe.
Harriet and Sophia Lee</h2>


<p>The novel of the mysterious and the supernatural
did not appear in modern literature
until Horace Walpole wrote <i>The Castle
of Otranto</i> in 1764, during the decade that was
dominated by the realism of Smollett and Sterne.
The author says it was an attempt to blend two
kinds of romance, the ancient, which was all improbable,
and the modern, which was a realistic
copy of nature. The machinery of this
novel is clumsy. An enormous helmet and a
huge sword are the means by which an ancestor
of Otranto, long since dead, restores the castle
to a seeming peasant, who proves to be the
rightful heir.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>This book produced no imitators until 1777,
when Clara Reeve wrote <i>The Old English
Baron</i>, which was plainly suggested by Walpole's
novel, but is more delicate in the treatment
of its ghostly visitants. Here, as in <i>The Castle of Otranto</i>,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
the rightful heir has been brought up
a peasant, ignorant of his high birth. Again his
ancestors, supposedly dead and gone, bring him
into his own. One night he is made to sleep in
the haunted part of the castle, where his parents
reveal to him in a dream things which he is
later able to prove legally. He learns the truth
about his birth, comes into his estate, and wins
the lady of his heart. When he returns to the
castle as its master, all the doors fly open
through the agency of unseen hands to welcome
their feudal lord.</p>

<p>The characters of both these novels are without
interest, and the mysterious element fails
to produce the slightest creepy thrill.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Twelve years passed before Walpole's novel
found another imitator in Mrs. Ann Radcliffe,
who so far excelled her two predecessors that
she has been called the founder of the Gothic
romance, and in this field she remains without
a peer. In her first novel, <i>The Castles of Athlin
and Dunbayne</i>, as in <i>The Old English Baron</i> by
Clara Reeve, a peasant renowned for his courage
and virtue loves and is beloved by a lady of rank.
A strawberry mark on his arm proves that he is
the Baron Malcolm and owner of the castle of
Dunbayne, at which juncture amid great rejoicings
the story ends.</p>

<p>The characters and the style foreshadow Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
Radcliffe's later work. The usurping Baron
of Dunbayne, who has imprisoned in his castle
the women who might oppose his ambition;
the two melancholy widows; their gentle and
pensive daughters; their brave, loyal, and
virtuous sons in love respectively with the
two daughters; the Count Santmorin, bold and
passionate, who endeavours by force to carry
off the woman he loves&mdash;these are types that
Mrs. Radcliffe repeatedly developed until in
her later novels they became real men and
women with strong conflicting emotions.</p>

<p>But superior to all her other powers is her
ability to awaken a feeling of the presence of
the supernatural. The castle of Dunbayne has
secret doors and subterranean passages. The
mysterious sound, as of a lute, is wafted on the
air from an unknown source. Alleyn, in endeavouring
to escape through a secret passage,
stumbles over something in the dark, and, on
stooping to learn what it is, finds the cold
hand of a corpse in his grasp. This dead man
has nothing to do with the story, but is introduced
merely to make the reader shudder, which
Mrs. Radcliffe never fails to do, even after we
have learned all the secrets of her art. We learn
later in the book how the corpse happened to be
left here unburied; for in that day of intense
realism, half-way between the ancient belief
in ghosts and the modern interest in mental<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
suggestion, every occurrence outside the known
laws of physics was greeted with a cynical
smile. But, although Mrs. Radcliffe always
explains the mystery in her books, we hold
our breath whenever she designs that we
shall.</p>

<p><i>The Sicilian Romance</i>, <i>The Romance of the
Forest</i>, <i>The Mysteries of Udolpho</i>, and <i>The
Italian</i> were written and published during the
next seven years and each one shows a marked
artistic advance over its predecessor. With the
opening paragraph of each, we are carried at
once into the land of the unreal, into regions of
poetry rather than of prose. Rugged mountains
with their concealed valleys, whispering forests
which the eye cannot penetrate, Gothic ruins
with vaulted chambers and subterranean passages,
are the scenes of her stories; while event
after event of her complicated plot happens
either just as the mists of evening are obscuring
the sun, or while the moonlight is throwing
fantastic shadows over the landscape. It is
an atmosphere of mystery in which one feels
the weird presence of the supernatural. This
is heightened by the ghostly suggestions she
brings to the mind, as incorporeal as spirits.
A low hurried breathing in the dark, lights
flashing out from unexpected places, forms
gliding noiselessly along the dark corridors, a
word of warning from an unseen source, cause<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
the reader to wait with hushed attention for the
unfolding of the mystery.</p>

<p>Sometimes the solution is trivial. The reader
and the inmates of Udolpho are held in suspense
chapter after chapter by some terrible appearance
behind a black veil. When Emily ventures
to draw the curtain, she drops senseless to the
ground. But this appearance turns out to be
merely a wax effigy placed there by chance.
Often the explanation is more satisfactory.
The disappearance of Ludovico during the
night from the haunted chamber where he was
watching in hopes of meeting the spirits that
infested it, makes the most sceptical believe for
a time in the reality of the ghostly visitants; and
his reappearance at the close of the book, the
slave of pirates who had found a secret passage
leading from the sea to this room, and had used
it as a place of rendezvous, is declared by Sir
Walter Scott to meet all the requirements of
romance.</p>

<p>But by a series of strange coincidences and
dreams Mrs. Radcliffe still makes us feel that
the destiny of her characters is shaped by an unseen
power. Adeline is led by chance to the
very ruin where her unknown father had been
murdered years before. She sees in dreams all
the incidents of the deed, and a manuscript
he had written while in the power of his enemies
falls into her hands. Again by chance she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
finds an asylum in the home of a clergyman,
Arnaud La Luc, who proves to be the father
of her lover, Theodore Peyrou. It seems to be
by the interposition of Providence that Ellena
finds her mother and is recognised by her father.
So in every tale we are made aware of powers
not mortal shaping human destiny.</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe adds to this consciousness of
the presence of the supernatural by another, perhaps
more legitimate, method. She felt what
Wordsworth expressed in <i>Tintern Abbey</i>, written
the year after her last novel was published:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">And I have felt</span><br />
A presence that disturbs me with the joy<br />
Of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime<br />
Of something far more deeply interfused,<br />
Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns,<br />
And the round ocean and the living air,<br />
And the blue sky, and in the mind of man;<br />
A motion and a spirit, that impels<br />
All thinking things, all objects of all thought,<br />
And rolls through all things.<br />
</p></div>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe seldom loses her feeling for nature,
and has a strong sense of the effect of
environment on her characters. Julia, when
in doubt about the fate of Hippolitus, often
walked in the evening under the shade of
the high trees that environed the abbey. "The
dewy coolness of the air refreshed her. The
innumerable roseate tints which the parting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
sun-beams reflected on the rocks above, and the
fine vermil glow diffused over the romantic
scene beneath, softly fading from the eye as the
night shades fell, excited sensations of a sweet
and tranquil nature, and soothed her into a
temporary forgetfulness of her sorrow." As the
happy lovers, Vivaldi and Ellena, are gliding
along the Bay of Naples, they hear from the
shore the voices of the vine-dressers, as they
repose after the labours of the day, and catch
the strains of music from fishermen who are
dancing on the margin of the sea.</p>

<p>Sometimes nature is prophetic. The whole
description of the castle of Udolpho, when
Emily first beholds it, is symbolical of the
sufferings she is to endure there: "As she
gazed, the light died away on its walls, leaving
a melancholy purple tint, which spread deeper
and deeper, as the thin vapour crept up the
mountain, while the battlements above were still
tipped with splendour. From these, too, the
rays soon faded, and the whole edifice was
invested with the solemn duskiness of evening.
Silent, lonely, and sublime it seemed to stand
the sovereign of the scene, and to frown defiance
on all who dared invade its solitary reign."
When Emily is happy in the peasant's home in
the valley below, she lingers at the casement
after the sun has set: "But a clear moonlight
that succeeded gave to the landscape what time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
gives to the scenes of past life, when it softens
all their harsh features, and throws over the
whole the mellowing shade of distant contemplation."
It is this feeling for nature as a constant
presence in daily life, now elating the mind with
joy, now awakening a sense of foreboding or inspiring
terror, and again soothing the mind to
repose, that gives to her books a permanent hold
upon the imagination and marks their author as
a woman of genius.</p>

<p>In her response to nature, she belongs to the
Lake School. Scott said of her: "Mrs. Radcliffe
has a title to be considered as the first
poetess of romantic fiction, that is, if actual
rhythm shall not be deemed essential to poetry."
Mrs. Smith describes nature as we all know it,
as it appears on the canvasses of Constable and
Wilson. Mrs. Radcliffe's descriptions of ideal
and romantic nature have earned for her the
name of the English Salvator Rosa.</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe's characters are not without
interest, although they are often mere types.
All her heroes and heroines are ladies and
gentlemen of native courtesy, superior education,
and accomplishments. In <i>The Mysteries
of Udolpho</i> she has set forth the education
which St. Aubert gave to his daughter, Emily:
"St. Aubert cultivated her understanding with
the most scrupulous care. He gave her a general
view of the sciences, and an exact acquaintance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
with every part of elegant literature. He taught
her Latin and English, chiefly that she might
understand the sublimity of their best poets.
She discovered in her early years a taste for
works of genius; and it was St. Aubert's principle,
as well as his inclination, to promote every
innocent means of happiness. 'A well informed
mind,' he would say, 'is the best security
against the contagion of vice and folly.'"</p>

<p>In all their circumstances her characters are
well-bred. This type has been nearly lost in literature,
due, perhaps, to the minuter study of
manners and the analysis of character. When an
author surveys his ladies and gentlemen through
a reading-glass, and points the finger at their
oddities and pries into their inmost secrets, even
the Chesterfields become awkward and clownish.
But Mrs. Radcliffe, like Mrs. Smith, is a true
gentlewoman, and speaks of her characters with
the delicate respect of true gentility. Julia,
Adeline, Emily, and Ellena, the heroines of four
of her books, love nature, and while away the
melancholy hours by playing on the lute or
writing poetry, and are, moreover, well qualified
to have charge of a baronial castle and its
dependencies. Her heroes are worthy of her
heroines. As they are generally seen in the
presence of ladies, if they have vices there is no
occasion for their display.</p>

<p>It is only in the characters of her villains<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
that good and evil are intertwined, and she
awakens our sympathy for them equally with
our horror. Monsieur La Motte, a weak man
in the power of an unscrupulous one, is the best
drawn character in <i>The Romance of the Forest</i>.
He has taken Adeline under his protection
and has been as a father to her. But before
this he had committed a crime which has placed
his life in the hands of a powerful marquis. To
free himself he consents to surrender Adeline
to the marquis, who has become enamoured
of her beauty, hoping by the sacrifice of her
honour to save his own life. He is agitated in
the presence of Adeline, and trembles at the
approach of any stranger. Scott said of him,
"He is the exact picture of the needy man who
has seen better days."</p>

<p>In <i>The Italian</i>, Schedoni, a monk of the order
of Black Penitents for whom the novel is named,
is guilty of the most atrocious crimes in order
that he may further his own ambition, but he is
not devoid of natural feeling. Scott says the
scene in which he "is in the act of raising his
arm to murder his sleeping victim, and discovers
her to be his own child, is of a new, grand, and
powerful character; and the horrors of the
wretch who, on the brink of murder, has just
escaped from committing a crime of yet more
exaggerated horror, constitute the strongest
painting which has been produced by Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
Radcliffe's pencil, and form a crisis well fitted
to be actually embodied on canvas by some
great master."</p>

<p>Every book has one or more gloomy, deep-plotting
villains. But all the people of rank
bear unmistakable marks of their nobility, even
when their natures have become depraved by
crime. In this she is the equal of Scott.</p>

<p>In every ruined abbey and castle there is a
servant who brings in a comic element and relieves
the strained feelings. Peter, Annette, and
Paulo are all faithful but garrulous, and often
bring disaster upon their masters by overzeal
in their service.</p>

<p>When Vivaldi, the hero of <i>The Italian</i>, is
brought before the tribunal of the inquisition,
his faithful servant, Paulo, rails bitterly at the
treatment his master has received. Vivaldi,
well knowing the danger which they both incur
by too free speech, bids him speak in a whisper:</p>

<p>"'A whisper,' shouted Paulo, 'I scorn to speak
in a whisper. I will speak so loud that every
word I say shall ring in the ears of all those
old black devils on the benches yonder, ay,
and those on that mountebank stage, too, that
sit there looking so grim and angry, as if they
longed to tear us in pieces. They&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'Silence,' said Vivaldi with emphasis. 'Paulo,
I command you to be silent.'</p>

<p>"'They shall know a bit of my mind,' contin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>ued
Paulo, without noticing Vivaldi. 'I will tell
them what they have to expect from all their
cruel usage of my poor master. Where do
they expect to go to when they die, I wonder?
Though for that matter, they can scarcely go
to a worse place than that they are in already,
and I suppose it is knowing that which makes
them not afraid of being ever so wicked. They
shall hear a little plain truth for once in their
lives, however; they shall hear&mdash;'"</p>

<p>But by this time Paulo is dragged from the
room.</p>

<p>The plots of all Mrs. Radcliffe's novels are
complicated. A whole skein is knotted and
must be unravelled thread by thread. <i>The
Mysteries of Udolpho</i> is the most involved.
Characters are introduced that are for a time
apparently forgotten; one sub-plot appears
within another, but at the end each is found
necessary to the whole.</p>

<p><i>The Italian</i> is simpler than the others: the
plot is less involved, and there are many strong
situations. The opening sentence at once
arouses the interests of the reader: "Within
the shade of the portico, a person with folded
arms, and eyes directed towards the ground,
was pacing behind the pillars the whole extent
of the pavement, and was apparently so
engaged by his own thoughts as not to observe
that strangers were approaching. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
turned, however, suddenly, as if startled by
the sound of steps, and then, without further
pausing, glided to a door that opened
into the church, and disappeared." Another
scene in which the Marchesa Vivaldi and Schedoni
are plotting the death of Ellena, is justly
famous. The former is actuated by the desire
to prevent her son's marriage to a woman of
inferior rank; the latter hopes that he may gain
an influence over the powerful Marchesa that
will lead to his promotion in the church. Their
conference, which takes place in the choir of
the convent of San Nicolo, is broken in upon
by the faint sound of the organ followed by
slow voices chanting the first requiem for the
dead.</p>

<p><i>The Italian</i> is generally considered the strongest
of Mrs. Radcliffe's novels. It was published
in 1797, and was as enthusiastically
received as were its predecessors, but for some
reason it was the last book Mrs. Radcliffe published.
Neither the fame it brought her, nor
the eight hundred pounds she received for it
from her publishers, tempted its author from
her life of retirement. Publicity was distasteful
to her. At the age of thirty-four, at an age
when many novelists had written nothing, she
ceased from writing, and spent the rest of her
years either in travel or in the seclusion of her
own home.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>The novel at this time was not considered
seriously as a work of art, and Mrs. Radcliffe
may have considered that she was but trifling
with time by employing her pen in that way.
In looking over the book reviews in <i>The Gentlemen's
Magazine</i> for the years from 1790 to 1800,
it is significant that, while column after column
is spent in lavish praise of a book of medicine
or science which the next generation proved
to be false, and of poetry that had no merit
except that its feet could be counted, seldom
is a novel reviewed in its pages. <i>The Mysteries
of Udolpho</i> was criticised for its lengthy descriptions,
and <i>The Italian</i> was ignored.</p>

<p>The direct influence of these novels on the
literature of the nineteenth century cannot
be estimated. Mrs. Radcliffe's influence upon
her contemporaries can be more easily traced.
The year after the publication of <i>The Mysteries
of Udolpho</i> Lewis wrote <i>The Monk</i>. This has
all the horrors but none of the refined delicacy
of Mrs. Radcliffe's work. Robert Charles Maturin
borrowed many suggestions from her, and the
gentle satire of <i>Northanger Abbey</i> could never
have been written if Jane Austen had not herself
come under the influence of <i>The Romance of
the Forest</i>.</p>

<p>But her greatest influence was upon Scott.
The four great realistic novelists of the eighteenth
century, Richardson, Fielding, Smollett and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
Sterne whose influence can be so often traced
in Thackeray and Dickens, seem never to have
touched the responsive nature of Scott. He
edited their works and often spoke in their
praise, but that which was deepest and truest in
him, which gave birth to his poetry and his
novels, seems never to have been aware of their
existence. Mrs. Radcliffe and Maria Edgewood
were his most powerful teachers.</p>

<p>Andrew Lang in the introduction to <i>Rob Roy</i>
in the Border edition of the <i>Waverley Novels</i>
calls attention to the fact that Waverley, Guy
Mannering, Lovel of <i>The Antiquary</i>, and Frank
Osbaldistone were all poets. Not only these
men, but others, as Edward Glendinning and
Edgar Ravenswood, bear a strong family
resemblance to Theodore Peyrou, Valancourt,
and Vivaldi, as well as to some of the other less
important male characters in Mrs. Radcliffe's
novels. Scott's men stand forth more clearly
drawn, while Mrs. Radcliffe's are often but dimly
outlined. Ellen Douglas, the daughter of an exiled
family; the melancholy Flora MacIvor, who
whiled away her hours by translating Highland
poetry into English; Mary Avenel, dwelling
in a remote castle, are all refined, educated
gentlewomen such as Mrs. Smith and Mrs.
Radcliffe delighted in, and are placed in situations
similar to those in which Julia, Adeline,
and Emily are found.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>But the heroines of Mrs. Smith and Mrs.
Radcliffe have a quality which not even Scott
has been able to give to his women. It is
expressed by a word often used during the reign
of the Georges, but since gone out of fashion.
They were women of fine sensibilities. Johnson
defines this as quickness of feeling, and it has
been used to mean a quickness of perception
of the soul as distinguished from the intellect.
The sensibilities of women may not be finer
than those of men, but they respond to a greater
variety of emotions. This gives to them a certain
evanescent quality which we find in Elizabeth
Bennet, Jane Eyre, Maggie Tulliver, Romola, the
portraits of Madame Le Brun and Angelica
Kauffman, and the poetry of Elizabeth Barrett
Browning. This quality men have almost never
grasped whether working with the pen or the
brush. Rosalind, Juliet, Viola, Beatrice, all possess
it; and in a less degree, Diana of the Crossways
is true to her sex in this respect. But the
features of nearly every famous Madonna, no
matter how skilful the artist that painted her,
are stiff and wooden when looked at from this
point of view, and Scott's heroines, with the
possible exception of Jeanie Deans, are immobile
when compared with woman as portrayed by
many an inferior artist of her own sex.</p>

<p>Scott's complicated plots and his constant
introduction of characters who are surrounded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
by mystery or are living in disguise again suggest
Mrs. Radcliffe. Again and again he selected
the same scenes that had appealed to her, and
in his earlier novels and poems he filled them in
with the same details which she had chosen.
Perhaps it is due to her influence that all the
hills of Scotland, as some critic has observed,
become mountains when he touches them:
"The sun was nearly set behind the distant
mountain of Liddesdale" was the beginning
of an early romance to have been entitled
<i>Thomas the Rhymer</i>. Knockwinnock Bay in
<i>The Antiquary</i> is first seen at sunset, and
it is night when Guy Mannering arrives at
Ellangowan Castle. Melrose is described by
moonlight. The sun as it sets in the Trossachs
brings to the mind of Scott the very outlines
and colours which Mrs. Radcliffe had used in
giving the first appearance of Udolpho, a scene
which Scott has highly praised; while these
famous lines of James Fitz-James have caught
the very essence of one of her favourite
spots:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
On this bold brow, a lordly tower;<br />
In that soft vale, a lady's bower;<br />
On yonder meadow, far away,<br />
The turrets of a cloister grey!<br />
How blithely might the bugle horn<br />
Chide, on the lake, the lingering morn!<br />
How sweet, at eve, the lover's lute<br />
Chime, when the groves were still and mute!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>And, when the midnight moon should lave<br />
Her forehead in the silver wave,<br />
How solemn on the ear would come<br />
The holy matin's distant hum.<br />
</p></div>

<p>In his later works Scott is tediously prosaic
in description, far inferior to Mrs. Radcliffe,
and in the romantic description of scenery he
never excels her. It would seem to be no mere
chance that in his poetry and in his earlier novels
he has so often struck the same key as did
the author of <i>The Mysteries of Udolpho</i>.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Two sisters, Harriet and Sophia Lee, were
writing books and finding readers during the
time of Mrs. Smith, Mrs. Inchbald, and Mrs.
Radcliffe. In 1784, Sophia Lee published a
three-volume novel, <i>The Recess</i>, a story of the
time of Queen Elizabeth, in which Elizabeth,
Mary Queen of Scots, and the earls Leicester,
Norfolk, and Essex play important r&ocirc;les. The
two heroines are unacknowledged daughters of
Mary Queen of Scots and Norfolk, to whom
she has been secretly married during her imprisonment
in England. Many other situations
in the book are equally fictitious.</p>

<p>The historical novels written in France during
the reign of Louis XIV paid no heed to chronology,
but men and women whom the author
knew well were dressed in the garb of historical
personages, and various periods of the past were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
brought into the space of the story. <i>The Recess</i>
was not a masquerade, but the plot and
characters slightly picture the reign of Elizabeth.
This was one of the first novels in which there
was an attempt to represent a past age with
something like accuracy. As this was one
of the first historical novels, using the term
in the modern sense, it had perhaps a right to be
one of the poorest; for it is impossible to conceive
three volumes of print in which there are
fewer sentences that leave any impress on the
mind than this once popular novel.</p>

<p>Sophia Lee wrote other novels which are said
to be worse than this; but in 1797 she and her
sister Harriet, who had the greater imagination,
published <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>. Some of
those written by Harriet are excellent. According
to the story a group of travellers have
met at an inn in Canterbury, where they are
delayed on account of a heavy fall of snow.
To while away the weary hours of waiting, as
they are gathered about the fire in true English
fashion, they agree, as did the Canterbury pilgrims
of long ago, that each one shall tell a story.
But the pilgrims whom Chaucer accompanied
to the shrine of Thomas &agrave; Becket are accurately
described, and between the tales they discuss
the stories and exchange lively banter in which
the nature of each speaker is clearly revealed.
In <i>The Canterbury Tales</i> there is little character-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>drawing.
Any one of the stories might have
been told by any one of the narrators, and before
the conclusion the authors dropped this device.</p>

<p>In the stories that are told the characters
are weak, but the plots are interesting and
many of them original and clever. These <i>Tales</i>
represent the beginning of the modern short
story.</p>

<p>In a preface to a complete edition of the
<i>Tales</i> published in 1832, Harriet Lee wrote:</p>

<p>"Before I finally dismiss the subject, I think
I may be permitted to observe that, when these
volumes first appeared, a work bearing distinctly
the title of <i>Tales</i>, professedly adapted
to different countries, and either abruptly commencing
with, or breaking suddenly into, a sort
of dramatic dialogue, was a novelty in the fiction
of the day. Innumerable <i>Tales</i> of the same
stamp, and adapted in the same manner to all
classes and all countries, have since appeared;
with many of which I presume not to compete
in merit, though I think I may fairly claim
priority of design and style."</p>

<p><i>The Canterbury Tales</i> were read and reread a
long time after they were written. A critic in
<i>Blackwood's</i> says of them:</p>

<p>"They exhibit more of that species of invention
which, as we have already remarked,
was never common in English literature than
any of the works of the first-rate novelists<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
we have named, with the single exception of
Fielding."</p>

<p>The most famous story of the collection is
<i>Kruitzener, or the German's Tale</i>. Part of the
story is laid in Silesia during the Thirty Years'
War. Frederick Kruitzener, a Bohemian, is
the hero, if such a term may be used for so weak
a man. In his youth he is thus described:</p>

<p>"The splendour, therefore, which the united
efforts of education, fortune, rank, and the
merits of his progenitors threw around him,
was early mistaken for a personal gift&mdash;a sort
of emanation proceeding from the lustre of his
own endowments, and for which, as he believed,
he was indebted to nature, he resolved not to be
accountable to man.... He was distinguished!&mdash;he
saw it&mdash;he felt it&mdash;he was persuaded he
should ever be so; and while yet a youth in the
house of his father&mdash;dependent on his paternal
affection, and entitled to demand credit of the
world merely for what he was to be&mdash;he secretly
looked down on that world as made only for
him."</p>

<p>The tale traces the troubles which Kruitzener
brings upon himself, his misery and his death.
It belongs to romantic literature; the mountain
scenes, a palace with secret doors, a secret gallery,
a false friend, a mysterious murder, all these
remind us of Mrs. Radcliffe's novels, but the
story does not possess her power or her poetic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
charm. Ernest Hartley Coleridge said of this
tale: "But the <i>motif</i>&mdash;a son predestined to evil
by the weakness and sensuality of his father, a
father's punishment for his want of rectitude
by the passionate criminality of his son, is the
very key-note of tragedy."</p>

<p>Byron read this story when he was about
fourteen, and it affected him powerfully. By
a strange coincidence Kruitzener bears a strong
resemblance to Lord Byron himself. He was
proud and melancholy, and, while he led a life
of pleasure, his spirits were always wrapped in
gloom. "It made a deep impression on me,"
writes Byron, "and may, indeed, be said to
contain the germ of much that I have since
written." In 1821, he dramatised it under the
title of <i>Werner, or the Inheritance</i>. The play
follows the novel closely both in plot and conversation.
An editor of Byron's works wrote
of it: "There is not one incident in his play,
not even the most trivial, that is not in Miss
Lee's novel. And then as to the characters&mdash;not
only is every one of them to be found in
<i>Kruitzener</i>, but every one is there more fully
and powerfully developed."</p>

<p><i>The Landlady's Tale</i> is far superior to all
others in the collection, if judged by present-day
standards. This story of sin and its punishment
reminds one in its moral earnestness
of George Eliot. Mr. Mandeville had brought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
ruin upon a poor girl, Mary Lawson, whose own
child died, when she became the wet nurse of
Robert, Mr. Mandeville's legitimate son and
heir. Mary grew to love the boy, but, when
the father threatened to expose her character
unless she would continue to be his mistress,
she ran away, taking the infant with her. She
became a servant in a lodging-house in Weymouth,
where she lived for fifteen years, respected
and beloved. At the end of that time,
Mr. Mandeville came to the house as a lodger,
where he neither recognised Mary nor knew his
son. But he disliked Robert, and paid no heed
to the fact that one of his own servants was
leading the boy into evil ways. When Robert
was accused of a crime which his own servant
had committed, he saw him sent to prison
and later transported with indifference. The
grief of the father when he learned that Robert
was his own child was most poignant, and his
unavailing efforts to save him are vividly told.
He is left bowed with grief, for he suffers under
the double penalty of "a reproachful world and
a reproaching conscience."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>

<h2>Maria Edgeworth. Lady Morgan</h2>


<p>"My real name is Thady Quirk, though in
the family I have always been known
by no other than 'honest Thady'; afterward, in
the time of Sir Murtagh, diseased, I remember
to hear them calling me 'old Thady,' and now
I'm come to 'poor Thady.'" Thus the faithful
servant of the Rackrent family introduces himself,
before relating the history of the lords of
the castle, where he and his had lived rent-free
time out of mind. And what consummate art
Maria Edgeworth showed in her first novel,
<i>Castle Rackrent</i>, in letting "poor Thady" ramble
with all the garrulity of old age. To him,
who had never been farther than a day's tramp
from the castle, there was nothing in the world's
history but it and its owners. No servant but
an Irish servant could have told the story as he
did, judging the characters of his masters with
shrewd wit and relating their worst failings
with a "God bless them."</p>

<p>And where out of Ireland could Thady have
found such masters, ready to spend all they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
had and another man's too, happy and free,
and dying as merrily as they had lived! There
was Sir Patrick, who, as Thady tells us, "could
sit out the best man in Ireland, let alone the
three kingdoms"; Sir Kit, who married a Jewess
for her money; and Sir Condy, who signed away
the estate rather than be bothered to look into
his steward's accounts, and then feigned that he
was dead that he might hear what his friends
said of him at the wake. But he soon came
to life, and a merry time they had of it. "But to
my mind," says Thady, "Sir Condy was rather
upon the sad order in the midst of it all, not
finding there was such a great talk about himself
after his death, as he had expected to hear."
But Thady loved his master, and it is with
genuine grief that he records his ultimate death,
and with simple and unconscious wit he adds,
"He had but a very poor funeral after all."</p>

<p>In <i>The Absentee</i>, the manners and customs
of the Irish peasants are more broadly delineated
than in <i>Castle Rackrent</i>. <i>The Absentee</i>
was written to call the attention of the Irish
landlords who were living in England to the
wretched condition of their tenants left in
the power of unscrupulous stewards. Lord
Colambre, the son of Lord Clonbrony, an absentee,
visits his father's estates, which he has
not seen for many years, in disguise, and goes
among the peasants, many of whom are in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
abject poverty. But the quick generosity of
the nation speaks in the poor Widow O'Neil's
"Kindly welcome, sir," with which she opens
the door to the unknown lord, and its enthusiastic
loyalty in the joyful acclamations of the
peasants when he reveals himself to them,&mdash;a
scene which Macaulay has pronounced the
finest in literature since the twenty-second book
of the <i>Odyssey</i>.</p>

<p><i>Ennui</i> is another of her stories of Irish life, in
which the supposed Earl of Glenthorn, after a
long residence in England, returns to his Irish
estates. The heroine of this tale is the old
nurse, Ellinor O'Donoghoe. As the nurses of
many stories are said to have done, she had substituted
her own child for the rightful heir, and
was frantic with joy when she saw him the
master of Glenthorn Castle. Her devotion to
the earl is pathetic, and her secret fears of
the deception she had practised on the old
earl may have prompted her strange speech
that, if it pleased God, she would like to die on
Christmas Day, of all days, "because the gates
of heaven will be open all that day; and who
knows but a body might slip in unbeknownst?"
Ellinor is a woman of many virtues and many
failings, but she is always pure Celt.</p>

<p>How well contrasted are the two cousins,
friends of Ormond, Sir Ulick O'Shane, a wily
politician and a member of Parliament, and Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
Cornelius O'Shane, King of the Black Islands,
called by his dependents King Corny. The
latter, bluff, generous, brave, open as the day,
is yet a match for his crafty kinsman. Sir
Ulick's visit to King Corny is a masterpiece.
He has a purpose in his visit and a secret to
guard, which King Corny is watching to discover.
Sir Ulick has been bantering his kinsman
on the old-fashioned customs observed on
his estate and ridicules his method of ploughing:</p>

<p>"'Your team, I see, is worthy of your tackle,'
pursued Sir Ulick. 'A mule, a bull, and two
lean horses. I pity the foremost poor devil
of a horse, who must starve in the midst of
plenty, while the horse, bull, and even mule, in
a string behind him, are all plucking and munging
away at their hay ropes.'</p>

<p>"Cornelius joined in Sir Ulick's laugh, which
shortened its duration.</p>

<p>"''Tis comical ploughing, I grant,' said he,
'but still, to my fancy, anything's better and
more profitable nor the tragi-comic ploughing
you practise every sason in Dublin.'</p>

<p>"'I?' said Sir Ulick.</p>

<p>"'Ay, you and all your courtiers, ploughing
the half-acre, continually pacing up and down
that castle-yard, while you're waiting in attendance
there. Every one to his own taste, but,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
"'If there's a man on earth I hate,<br />
Attendance and dependence be his fate.'"<br />
</p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>King Corny has been studying his diplomatic
kinsman carefully to learn his secret, until the
wily politician, by unnecessary caution in guarding
it, overreaches himself, when King Corny
exclaims to himself:</p>

<p>"Woodcocked! That he has, as I foresaw
he would."</p>

<p>While the trained diplomat murmurs as he
takes his leave, "All's safe."</p>

<p>Native wit had got the better of artful
cunning.</p>

<p>And when Sir Ulick dies in disgrace, how
pithy is the remark of one of the men, as he
is filling in the grave:</p>

<p>"There lies the making of an excellent gentleman&mdash;but
the cunning of his head spoiled the
goodness of his heart."</p>

<p>In the same book, how generous and how
Irish is Moriarty, lying on the brink of death,
as he thinks of Ormond, who had shot him in a
fit of passion but bitterly repented his rash deed:</p>

<p>"I'd live through all, if possible, for his sake,
let alone my mudther's, or shister's or my own&mdash;'t
would be too bad, after all the trouble he got
these two nights, to be dying at last, and hanting
him, maybe, whether I would or no."</p>

<p>The quick kindness which so often twists
an Irishman's tongue is humorously illustrated
in the <i>Essay on Irish Bulls</i>, which Maria
Edgeworth and her father wrote together. Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
Phelim O'Mooney, disguised as Sir John Bull, accepts
his brother's wager that he cannot remain
four days in England without the country of his
birth being discovered eight times. Whenever
his speech betrays him, it is the result of his
emotions. When he sees Bourke, a pugilist
of his own country, overcome by an Englishman,
he cries to him excitedly: "How are you,
my gay fellow? Can you see at all with the
eye that is knocked out?" A little later, in
discussing a certain impost duty, he grows
angry and exclaims: "If I had been the English
minister, I would have laid the dog-tax upon
cats." The humour of his situation increases
to a climax, so that the fun never flags. Such
stories as this in which the wit is simply sparkling
good-nature, with no attempt to use it as
a weapon against frail humanity as did Fielding
and Thackeray, or to produce a smile by exaggeration
as did Dickens, but simply bubbling
fun, as free from guile as the sun's laughter on
Killarney, show that Miss Edgeworth was a
comedian of the first rank. Like all true comedians,
she is also strong in the pathetic, but it
is the Irish pathos, in which there is ever a
smile amid the tears. This is found in the story
of the return of Lady Clonbrony to her own country;
the fall of Castle Rackrent; and the ruin by
their sudden splendour of the family of Christy
O'Donoghoe.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>Whenever Miss Edgeworth writes of Ireland
and its people, her pages glow with the inspiration
of genius. There is no exaggeration, no
caricature; all is told with simple truth. It
has often been the fate of novelists whose aim
has been to depict the manners and customs
of a locality to win the ill-will of the obscure
people they have brought into prominence.
But not so with Maria Edgeworth. Her family,
although originally English, had been settled
for two hundred years in Ireland. She loved
the country and always wrote of it with a loving
pen. Before <i>Castle Rackrent</i> was written, Ireland
had been for many centuries an outcast
in literature, known only for her blunders and
bulls. But, as one of her characters says, "An
Irish bull is always of the head, never of the
heart." Even though her characters are humorous,
they are never clowns. All the men have
dignity, and all the women grace. She gave
them a respectable place in literature.</p>

<p>But her influence was felt outside of Ireland.
Old Thady, in his garrulous description of the
masters of Castle Rackrent, had introduced the
first national novel, in which the avowed object
is to represent traits of national character.
Patriotic writers in other countries learned
through her how to serve their own land,
and she was one of the many influences
which led to the writing of the Waverley<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
novels. Scott says in the preface of these
books:</p>

<p>"Without being so presumptuous as to hope
to emulate the rich humour, pathetic tenderness,
and admirable tact which pervade the work
of my accomplished friend, I felt that something
might be attempted for my own country,
of the same kind with that which Miss Edgeworth
so fortunately achieved for Ireland&mdash;something
which might introduce her natives to
those of the sister kingdom in a more favourable
light than they had been placed hitherto,
and tend to procure sympathy for their virtues
and indulgence for their foibles."</p>

<p>As the reader realises the power of Maria
Edgeworth's mind, her ability to describe manners
and customs, to read character, and to
depict comic and tragic scenes, he wishes that
her father, Richard Lovell Edgeworth, had not
so constantly interfered in her work, and insisted
that every book she wrote must illustrate
some principle of education. He was not singular
in this respect. Rousseau, whom he
greatly admired at one time, had taught educational
methods by a novel. Madame de
Genlis, the teacher of Louis Philippe, was
writing novels that were celebrated throughout
Europe, in which she expounded rules for the
training of the young. Maria Edgeworth, with
her father at her elbow, never lost sight of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
moral of her tale. Vivian, in the story of that
name, was so weak that he was always at
the mercy of the artful. Ormond's passions
led him into trouble. Beauclerc was almost
ruined by his foolish generosity. Lady Delacour,
with no object in life but pleasure,
cast aside her own happiness that she
might outshine the woman she hated. Lady
Clonbrony squandered her fortune and health
that she might be snubbed by her social superiors.
Mrs. Beaumont played a deep diplomatic
game in her small circle of friends, and
finally overreached herself. Lady Cecilia, the
friend of Helen, brought sorrow to her and
infamy upon herself by her duplicity. In the
analysis of motive, and the growth of Cecilia's
wrong-doing from a small beginning, the book
resembles the novels of George Eliot. But
Maria Edgeworth could not know her own
characters as she otherwise would, because the
moral was always uppermost. When Mrs.
Inchbald criticised her novel <i>Patronage</i>, she
replied: "Please to recollect, we had our moral
to work out." Mr. Edgeworth, in his preface
to <i>Tales of Fashionable Life</i>, thus sets forth
his daughter's purpose:</p>

<p>"It has been my daughter's aim to promote
by all her works the progress of education from
the cradle to the grave. All the parts of this
series of moral fiction bear upon the faults and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
excellencies of different ages and classes; and
they have all risen from that view of society
which we have laid before the public in more
didactic works on education."</p>

<p>Such a method of writing tended to kill emotion,
yet emotion breaks out at times with
genuine force, and always has a true ring. This
is especially true in the <i>Tales of Fashionable
Life</i>. There society women appear cold and
heartless in the drawing-room, and so they
have generally been represented in fiction. So
Thackeray regarded them. But Maria Edgeworth
followed them to the boudoir, and there
reveals beneath the laces and jewels many beautiful
womanly traits. As we see in tale after
tale true feeling welling to the surface, and
then choked up by the moral, we recognise the
pathetic truth that Mr. Edgeworth's educational
methods were fatal to genius.</p>

<p>But strong emotion sways only a small part
of the lives of most men and women. Were
it otherwise, like the great lyric poets, we should
all die young. And she has written about the
common, everyday, prosaic life with a truthfulness
rarely excelled.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting studies in a
novel is to observe the author's view of life.
With the exception of those of Mademoiselle De
Scud&eacute;ri nearly all the novels of French women
considered love as the ruling passion for happi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>ness
or woe, and all of the characters were under
its sway. Even Mademoiselle De Scud&eacute;ri in the
preface to <i>Ibrahim</i> announced it as her distinct
purpose that all her heroes were to be ruled by
the two most sublime passions, love and ambition;
but she was a humorist and unconsciously
interested her readers more by her witty descriptions
of people than by the loves of Cyrus and
Mandane. But this passion has seldom held such
an exaggerated place in the stories of English
women. Maria Edgeworth in particular noticed
that men and women were actuated by many
motives or passions. A large income or a title
was often capable of inspiring a feeling so akin
to love that even the bosom that felt its glow
was unable to distinguish the difference. Loss
of respect could kill the strongest passion, and
some of her heroines have even remained single,
or else married men whom at first they had
regarded with indifference, rather than marry
the object of their first love after he had forfeited
their esteem. Sometimes the tameness
of her heroines shocked their author. While
correcting <i>Belinda</i> for Mrs. Barbauld's "Novelists'
Library," Miss Edgeworth wrote to a
friend:</p>

<p>"I really was so provoked with the cold
tameness of that stick or stone Belinda, that I
could have torn the pages out."</p>

<p>Propinquity, opportunity, almost a mental<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
suggestion are quite enough to produce a long
chain of events affecting a lifetime. "Ask half
the men you are acquainted with why they are
married, and their answer, if they speak the
truth, will be, 'Because I met Miss Such-a-One
at such a place, and we were continually
together.' 'Propinquity, propinquity,' as my
father used to say, and he was married five
times, and twice to heiresses." So speaks
Mrs. Broadhurst, a match-making mother in
<i>The Absentee</i>. And this is the reason why most
of Miss Edgeworth's heroes and heroines love.
But the advances of a designing woman are
quite sufficient, as in <i>Vivian</i>, to make a fond
lover forget his plighted troth to another, and the
flattery of an unscrupulous man makes him suspicious
of his real friends. Character is destiny,
if the character is strong, but circumstances
are destiny, if the character is weak. It is the
aim of her novels to show how certain traits
of character, as indecision, pride, love of luxury,
indolence, lead to misfortune, and how these
dangerous traits may be overcome.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Notwithstanding her moral, her plots are
never hackneyed and never repeated. They are
drawn from life and have the variety of life.
In the story of <i>Ennui</i>, there is the twice-told
tale of the nurse's son substituted for the real
heir; but when he learns the true story of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
birth, and resigns the castle, the title, and all
its wealth to the rightful Earl of Glenthorn, who
has been living in the village working at the forge,
there is a great change from the usual story. The
heir of the ancient family of Glenthorn accepts
the earldom for his son, but with reluctance. The
manners of the peasant remain with the earl, and
the poor man, at last, begs the one who has been
educated for the position to accept the title and
the estates. In this she emphasised again what
she constantly taught, that education and environment
are more powerful than heredity.</p>

<p>As she taught that reason should be the guide
of life, so she lived. Her fourscore years and
three were spent largely at her ancestral home
of Edgeworthstown. She assisted her father
in making improvements to better the condition
of the tenantry, and to promote their happiness.
When in Paris, she met a Mr. Edelcrantz,
a gentleman in the service of the king of Sweden.
Admiration was succeeded by love. But he
could not leave the court at Stockholm, and
Miss Edgeworth felt that neither duty nor inclination
would permit her to leave her quiet life
in Ireland. Reason was stronger than love.
So they parted like her own heroes and heroines.
All that history records of him is that he never
married. She resumed her responsibilities at
home, and if the thought of this separation
sometimes brought the tears to her eyes, as her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
stepmother once wrote to a friend, she was as
cheerful, gay, and light-hearted in the home
circle as she had always been.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Besides her moral tales for adults, which were
read throughout Europe, Maria Edgeworth was
always interested in the education of boys and
girls. The eldest sister in a family of twenty-one
children, the offspring of four marriages,
she taught her younger brothers and sisters,
and thus grew to know intimately the needs
of childhood and what stories would appeal
to them. As her father wrote, it was her
"aim to promote by all her works the progress
of education from the cradle to the grave."
In her stories for children she inculcated lessons
of industry, economy, thoughtfulness, and
unselfishness.</p>

<p>If she helped to eradicate from the novel its
false, highly colored sentimental pictures of life,
still greater was her work in producing literature
for young people. Hers were among the
first wholesome stories written for children.
Before this the chapman had carried about with
him in his pack small paper-covered books
which warned boys and girls of the dangers
of a life of crime. One book was named <i>An
hundred godly lessons which a mother on her
death-bed gave to her children</i>. Another book
of religious and moral Sunday reading was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
called <i>The Afflicted Parent, or the Undutiful
Child Punished</i>. This gives the sad history
of the two children of a gentleman in Chester,
a son and a daughter. The daughter
chided her brother for his wickedness, upon
which he struck her and killed her. He was
hanged for this, but even then his punishment
was not completed. He came back to life,
told the minister several wicked deeds which
he had committed, and was hanged a second
time. In most of these tales the gallows loomed
dark and threatening.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In contrast to these morbid tales are the
wholesome stories of Maria Edgeworth. The
boys and girls about whom she writes are drawn
from life. If they are bad, their crimes are
never enormous, but simply a yielding to the
common temptations of childhood. Hal, in
<i>Waste Not, Want Not</i>, thinks economy beneath
a gentleman's notice, and at last loses a prize
in an archery contest for lack of a piece of string
which he had destroyed. Fisher in <i>The Barring
Out</i>, a cowardly boy, buys twelve buns for
himself with a half-crown which belonged to his
friend, and then gives a false account of the
money. His punishment is expulsion from
the school. Lazy Lawrence has a worse fate.
He will not work, plays pitch farthing, is led
by bad companions to steal, and is sent to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
Bridewell. But he is not left in a hopeless
condition. After he had served his term of imprisonment
he became remarkable for his
industry.</p>

<p>But there are more good boys and girls than
bad ones in her stories. The love of children
for their parents, and the sacrifices they will
make for those they love, are beautifully told.
In the story of <i>The Orphans</i>, Mary, a girl of
twelve, finds a home for her brothers and sisters,
after her father and mother die, in the ruins of
Rossmore Castle, where they support themselves
by their labour. Mary finds that she
can make shoes of cloth with soles of platted
hemp, and by this industry the children earn
enough for all their needs. As directions are
given for making these shoes, any little girl
reading the story would know how to follow
the example of Mary. Jem in the story of
<i>Lazy Lawrence</i> finds that there are many ways
by which he can earn the two guineas without
which his horse Lightfoot must be sold. He
works early and late, and at last accomplishes
his purpose.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ritchie says of this story: "Lightfoot
deserves to take his humble place among the
immortal winged steeds of mythology along
with Pegasus, or with Black Bess, or Balaam's
Ass, or any other celebrated steeds."</p>

<p>The story of <i>Simple Susan</i> with its pictures<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
of village life has the charm of an idyl. The
children by the hawthorn bush choosing their
May Queen; Susan with true heroism refusing
this honour, in order that she may care for her
sick mother; the incident of the guinea-hen;
Rose's love for Susan; the old harper, playing
tunes to the children grouped about him&mdash;are
all simply told. Susan's love for her pet lamb
reminds one of Wordsworth's poem of that
name.</p>

<p>And yet these children are not unusual.
Most boys and girls have days when they are
as good as Mary, or Jem, or Susan. Maria
Edgeworth is not inculcating virtues which are
impossible of attainment.</p>

<p>A hundred years ago, these stories, as they
came from the pen of Maria Edgeworth, delighted
boys and girls, and for at least fifty years
were read by parents and children. Then for
a time they were hidden in libraries, but a collection
of them has lately been edited by Mr.
Charles Welsh under the appropriate title <i>Tales
that never Die</i>, which have proved as interesting
to the children of to-day as to those of by-gone
generations.</p>

<p>Whether Maria Edgeworth is writing for old
or young, there is one marked trait in all her
stories, her kind feeling for all humanity. The
vices of her villains are recorded in a tone of
sorrow. She seldom uses satire; never "makes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
fun" of her characters. Her attitude towards
them is that of the lady of Edgeworthstown
towards her dependents, or rather that of the
elder sister towards the younger members of the
family. Such broad and loving sympathy is
found in Shakespeare and Scott, but seldom
among lesser writers.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In Sydney Owenson, better known by her
married name of Lady Morgan, Ireland found
at this time another warm but less judicious
friend. Her life was more interesting than her
books. Her father, an Irish actor, introduced
his daughter, while yet a child, to his associates,
so that she appeared in society at an early age.
But Mr. Owenson was improvident; debts accumulated,
and Sydney at the age of fourteen
began to earn her own living. The position
of a governess, which she filled for a time, being
unsuited to her gay, independent disposition,
she began to write. Like Johnson a half century
or more earlier, with a play in manuscript
as her most valuable possession, she went alone
to London. She did not wait so long as he
did for recognition. New books by new authors
were eagerly read. She earned money, a social
position, fame, and with it some disagreeable
notoriety. An independent, witty Irish woman
of great charm, fearless in expressing her opinions,
who had introduced herself into society<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
and for whom nobody stood as sponsor, was
looked upon by the old-fashioned English
aristocracy as an adventuress; and later, when
she came forth as the champion of Irish liberties,
and upbraided England for tyranny, she was
maliciously denounced by the Tory party.</p>

<p>She entered upon life with three purposes, to
each of which she adhered: to advocate the
interest of Ireland by her writings; to pay her
father's debts; and to provide for his old age.
All of these purposes she accomplished.</p>

<p>Besides plays and poems, and two or three
insignificant stories, she wrote four novels upon
Irish subjects: <i>The Wild Irish Girl</i>, <i>O'Donnel</i>,
<i>Florence Macarthy</i>, and <i>The O'Briens and the
O'Flahertys</i>. In all these books the beauty of
Irish scenery is depicted as background; the
fashionable life of Dublin is described, as well
as the peasant life in remote hamlets; while the
natural resources of the land and the native
gaiety of the Celtic temperament are feelingly
contrasted with the poverty and misery brought
about by unjust laws.</p>

<p>She thus feelingly describes the condition of
Ireland in the novel <i>O'Donnel</i>. Its sincerity
must excuse its overwrought style: "Silence and
oblivion hung upon her destiny, and in the
memory of other nations she seemed to hold
no place; but the first bolt which was knocked
off her chain roused her from paralysis, and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
as link fell after link, her faculties strengthened,
her powers revived; she gradually rose upon
the political horizon of Europe, like her own
star brightening in the west, and lifting its light
above the fogs, vapours, and clouds, which
obscured its lustre. The traveller now beheld
her from afar, and her shores, once so devoutly
pressed by the learned, the pious, and the brave,
again exhibited the welcome track of the stranger's
foot. The natural beauties of the land
were again explored and discovered, and taste
and science found the reward of their enterprise
and labours in a country long depicted as
savage, because it had long been exposed to
desolation and neglect."</p>

<p>In this book a party of travellers visits the
Giant's Causeway and its scenery is described
as an almost unfrequented place.</p>

<p>The new interest in Ireland of which she
writes was very largely due to the novels of
Maria Edgeworth, and partly to those of Lady
Morgan herself.</p>

<p>Her last novel, <i>The O'Briens and the O'Flahertys</i>,
is of historic value. Its plot was furnished
by the stirring events which took place when the
Society of United Irishmen were fighting for parliamentary
reforms. Lord Edward Fitzgerald,
the devoted patriot, is easily recognised in the
brave Lord Walter Fitzwalter, and the life of
Thomas Corbet furnished the thrilling adven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>tures
of the hero, Lord Arranmore. When
Thomas Moore visited Thomas Corbet at Caen
he referred to the account given of his escape
from prison in Lady Morgan's novel as remarkably
accurate in its details.</p>

<p>The style of Miss Owenson's earlier books
was execrable and fully justified the severe
criticism in the first number of the <i>Quarterly
Review</i>. It gives this quotation from <i>Ida, or
the Woman of Athens</i>: "Like Aurora, the extremities
of her delicate limbs were rosed with
flowing hues, and her little foot, as it pressed its
naked beauty on a scarlet cushion, resembled
that of a youthful Thetis from its blushing tints,
or that of a fugitive Atalanta from its height."
The wonder is that any serious magazine should
have wasted two pages of space upon such
nonsense. In ridiculing the book and the
author, it gives her some serious advice, with
the encouragement that if she follow it, she
may become, not a writer of novels, but the
happy mistress of a family.</p>

<p>Whether Lady Morgan took this ill-meant
advice or not, her style improved with each
book, until in <i>The O'Briens and the O'Flahertys</i>
it became simple and clear, with only an occasional
tendency to high colouring and bombast.</p>

<p>Maria Edgeworth has described the customs
and manners of Ireland, and unfolded the
character of its people in a manner that has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
never been equalled. But Lady Morgan, far
inferior as an artist, has given fuller and more
picturesque descriptions of the landscape of
the country, and has made a valuable addition
to the books bearing on the history of Ireland.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>

<h2>Elizabeth Hamilton. Anna Porter.
Jane Porter</h2>


<p>Elizabeth Hamilton was also an Irish
writer, but through her one novel she will
always be associated with Scotland. In <i>The
Cottagers of Glenburnie</i> she did for the Scotch
people what Maria Edgeworth had done for the
Irish, and represented for the first time in
fiction the life of the common people. It is a
story of poor people of the serving class. Mrs.
Mason, who had been an upper servant in the
family of a lord, has been pensioned and takes
up her abode with a cousin in the village of
Glenburnie. She was among the earliest of our
settlement workers. This little village with the
pretty name, situated in a beautiful country,
had accumulated about its homes as much filth
as the tenements of the poorest ward of a large
city, and for the same reason, that its inhabitants
did not understand the value of cleanliness.
Its thatched cottages, had it not been for their
chimneys and the smoke issuing from them,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
would have passed for stables or hog-sties, for
there was a dunghill in front of every door.</p>

<p>Mrs. MacClarty's cottage, where Mrs. Mason
was to live, was like all the rest. It was as
dirty inside as out. Mrs. MacClarty picked up
a cloth from the floor beside her husband's
boots, with which to wipe her dishes, and made
her cheese in a kettle which had not been washed
since the chickens had eaten their last meal
from it, although the remains of their feast still
adhered to the sides. When Mrs. MacClarty
put her black hands into the cheese to stir it,
Mrs. Mason reminded her gently that she had
not washed them:</p>

<p>"'Hoot,' returned the gudewife, 'my hands
do weel eneugh. I canna be fash'd to clean
them at ilka turn.'"</p>

<p>When Mrs. Mason proposed that the windows
should be hung on hinges and supplied with
iron hooks, so that they could be opened at
pleasure, Mr. MacClarty objected to the plan:</p>

<p>"'And wha do you think wad put in the
cleek?' returned he. 'Is there ane, think ye,
aboot this hoose, that would be at sic a fash?'</p>

<p>"'Ilka place has just its ain gait,' said the
gudewife, 'and ye needna think that ever we'll
learn yours. And, indeed, to be plain wi' you,
cusine, I think you hae owre mony fykes.
There, didna ye keep Grizzy for mair than twa
hours, yesterday morning, soopin' and dustin'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
your room in every corner, an' cleanin' out the
twa bits of buird, that are for naething but to
set your foot on after a'?'"</p>

<p>It may be well to explain that the chickens
had been roosting in this chamber before Mrs.
Mason's arrival.</p>

<p>The story of Mr. MacClarty's death is pathetic.
He is lying ill with a fever in the press-bed
in the kitchen, where not a breath of air
reaches him. The neighbours have crowded in
to offer sympathy. The doors are tightly closed,
and his wife has piled blankets over him and
given him whiskey and hot water to drink.
When Mrs. Mason, who knows that with proper
care his life can be saved, urges that he be removed
to her room where he can have air, all
the neighbours violently oppose her advice. But
Peter MacGlashon, the oracle of the village,
looks at it more philosophically:</p>

<p>"'If it's the wull o' God that he's to dee, it's
a' ane whar ye tak him; ye canna hinder the
wull o' God.'"</p>

<p>But upon Mrs. Mason's insisting that we
should do our best to save the life of the sick
with the reason God has given us, Peter becomes
alarmed:</p>

<p>"'That's no soond doctrine,' exclaimed
Peter. 'It's the law of works.'"</p>

<p>Elizabeth Hamilton had been a teacher and
had written books on education, so that her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
description of the school which Mrs. Mason
opened in the village gives an accurate idea
of the Scottish schools for the poorer classes.
Each class was divided into landlord, tenants,
and under-tenants, one order being responsible
for a specific amount of reading and writing to
the order above it. The landlord was responsible
to the master both for his own diligence
and the diligence of his vassals. If the
tenants disobeyed the laws they were tried
by a jury of their mates. The results of the
training at Mrs. Mason's school might well be
an aim of teachers to-day: "To have been
educated at the school of Glenburnie implied
a security for truth, diligence and honesty."</p>

<p>The pupils in the school gradually learned
to love cleanliness and order. The little flower-garden
in front gave pleasure to all. The
villagers declared, "The flowers are a hantel
bonnier than the midden and smell a hantel
sweeter, too." With this improvement in
taste, the "gude auld gaits" gave way to a
better order of things.</p>

<p><i>The Cottagers of Glenburnie</i> is more realistic
in detail than anything which had yet been
written. It is a short simple story told in simple
language. There is a slight plot, but it is
the village upon which our attention is fastened.
One individual stands out more strongly than
the rest: that is Mrs. MacClarty with her con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>stant
expression, "It is well eneugh. I canna
be fashed."</p>

<p>This little book was read in every Scotch
village, and many of the poor people saw in it
a picture of their own homes. But its sound
common-sense appealed to them. It was reasonable
that butter without hairs would sell
for more than with them, and that gardens
without weeds would produce more vegetables
than when so encumbered. The book did for
the cottagers of Scotland what Mrs. Mason had
done for those of Glenburnie.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The lives of Anna Maria and Jane Porter
resemble in a few particulars that of Elizabeth
Hamilton. Like her they belonged, at least
on the father's side, to Ireland, and like her
they lived in Scotland, and their names will
always be associated with that country. But
Elizabeth Hamilton wrote the first novel of
Scotland's poor, the ancestor of <i>The Window
in Thrums</i> and <i>Beside the Bonnie Brier Bush</i>;
Jane Porter wrote the first novel of Scotland's
kings, the immediate forerunner of <i>Waverley</i>,
<i>The Abbot</i>, and <i>The Monastery</i>.</p>

<p>Upon the death of Major Porter, who had
been stationed for some years with his regiment
at Durham, Mrs. Porter removed to Edinburgh,
where her children were educated. Their quick
lively imaginations found food for growth on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
Scottish soil. At that time Caledonia was a
land of cliff and crag, inhabited by a quarrelsome
people, whom the English still regarded with
something the same aversion which Dr. Johnson
had so often expressed to Boswell. But every
castle had its story of brave knights and fair
ladies, and every brae had been the scene of
renowned deeds of arms. In every cottage the
memory of the past was kept alive, and fathers
and mothers related to their children stories
of Wallace and of Bruce, until the romantic
past became more real than the living present.
Mrs. Porter's servants delighted to relate to
her eager children stories of Scotland's glory.
The maids would sing to them the songs of
"Wallace wight," and the serving-man would
tell them tales of Bannockburn and Cambus-Kenneth.</p>

<p>Rarely have stories fallen on such fertile soil.
In a short time, three of these children became
famous. Sir Robert Ker Porter, the brother of
Anna and Jane, followed closely in the
footsteps of Scotland's heroes, and became distinguished
as a soldier and diplomat, as well
as a famous painter of battles. He painted the
enormous canvas of <i>The Storming of Seringapatam</i>,
a sensational panorama, one hundred
and twenty feet in length, the first of its kind,
but in a style that has often been followed in
recent years. The idol of his family, it would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
seem that he was endowed with many of those
qualities which his sisters gave to the heroes
of their romances.</p>

<p>Anna Maria Porter, the youngest of the group,
was the first to appear in print. At the age of
fifteen, she published a little volume called
<i>Artless Tales</i>. From this time until her death,
at least every two years a new book from her
pen was announced. She wrote a large number
of historical romances, which were widely read
and translated into many languages. This kind
of story, in the hands of Sophia Lee, was tame
and uninteresting. Anna Porter increased its
scope and its popularity. Her plots are well
worked out with many thrilling adventures.
Her imagination, however, had been quickened
by reading, not by observation, and although
her scenes cover many countries of Europe
and many periods of history, they differ but
little in pictorial detail, and her characters are
lifeless. Her style of writing is, moreover, so
inflated that it gives an air of unreality to her
books.</p>

<p>She thus describes the Hungarian brothers:
"They were, indeed, perfect specimens of the
loveliness of youth and the magnificence of
manhood." This novel, dealing with the French
Revolution, was one of the most popular of
all her stories. It went through several editions
both in England and on the continent. Super<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>lative
expressions seem to have been fashionable
in that age which was still encumbered by much
that was artificial in dress and manners. Miss
Porter with proper formality thus writes of
her heroine as she was recovering from a fainting
fit: "With a blissful shiver, Ippolita slowly
unclosed her eyes, and turning them round,
with such a look as we may imagine blessed
angels cast, when awakening amid the raptures
of another world, she met those of her sweet
and gracious uncle."</p>

<p>Some of her society novels are witty and have
a lively style, which suggests the truth of Mr.
S. C. Hall's description of the sisters. Anna,
a blonde, handsome and gay, he named L'Allegro,
in contrast to Jane, a brunette, equally
handsome, but with the dignified manners of the
heroines of her own romances, whom he styled
Il Penseroso.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Jane Porter took a more serious view of the
responsibilities of authorship than her sister.
Her first novel, <i>Thaddeus of Warsaw</i>, was
written while England was agitated against
France and excited over the wrongs of Poland.
It grew out of popular feeling. Miss Porter had
become acquainted with friends of Kosciusko,
men who had taken part with him in his country's
struggle for liberty, and made him the
hero of the story. The scenery of Poland was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
so well described that the Poles refused to believe
that she had not visited their country;
and events were related in a manner so pleasing
to them that they distinguished the author by
many honours. It is one thing to write an
historical novel of people and events that have
long been buried in oblivion; but to write a story
of times so near the present that its chief actors
are still living, is, indeed, a rash task. And
for any history to meet with the approval of
its hero and his friends bespeaks rare excellence
in the work.</p>

<p>In the light of the classic standing of the
historical novel, due to the genius of Scott and
Dumas, it is interesting to read how <i>Thaddeus
of Warsaw</i> came to be published. Miss Porter
wrote the romance merely for her own amusement,
with no thought of its being read outside
the circle of her family and intimate friends.
They urged her to publish it. But for a long
time she resisted their importunities on the
ground that it did not belong to any known
style of writing: stories of real life, like <i>Tom
Jones</i>, or improbable romances, like <i>The Mysteries
of Udolpho</i>, were the only legitimate forms
of fiction. <i>Thaddeus of Warsaw</i> had the exact
details of history with a romance added to
please the author's fancy. Thus did Jane
Porter discover to the world the possibilities
of the historical novel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>Her next novel, <i>The Scottish Chiefs</i>, grew
out of the stories she had heard in her childhood.
Besides the tales of Scotland's struggle for independence
which she heard from the servants
in her own home, a venerable old woman called
Luckie Forbes, who lived not far from Mrs.
Porter's house, used to tell her of the wonderful
deeds of William Wallace. Of the influence
these stories had upon her childish mind, Jane
Porter has thus written:</p>

<p>"I must avow, that to Luckie Forbes's
familiar, and even endearing, manner of narrating
the lives of William Wallace and his
dauntless followers; her representation of their
heart-sacrifices for the good of their country,
filling me with an admiration and a reverential
amazement, like her own; and calling forth my
tears and sobs, when she told of the deaths of
some, and of the cruel execution of the virtuous
leader of them all;&mdash;to her I must date my
early and continued enthusiasm in the character
of Sir William Wallace! and in the friends his
truly hero-soul delighted to honour."</p>

<p>Before writing <i>The Scottish Chiefs</i>, Miss Porter
read everything she could find bearing upon
the history of England and Scotland during
the reigns of the first two Edwards. She personally
visited the places she described. She
wrote in the preface: "I assure the reader that
I seldom lead him to any spot in Scotland<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
whither some written or oral testimony respecting
my hero had not previously conducted
myself." Besides these sources of information,
Miss Porter was familiar with the poem of
<i>Wallace</i> by Blind Harry the Minstrel, the
biographer of Scotland's national hero. Blind
Harry lived nearly two centuries after the death
of Wallace, but he had access to books now
lost, and collected stories about Scotland's
struggle for independence while it was still
prominent in the public mind. Although he
tells many exalted stories of the numbers whom
Wallace overcame by his single arm, the poem
is on the whole authentic. Sheriff Mackay
in the <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i> writes
that the life of Wallace by Blind Harry "became
the secular bible of his countrymen, and echoes
through their later history." Miss Porter introduced
love scenes to vary the deeds of war,
but there is nothing else in <i>The Scottish Chiefs</i>
which is not true to history, or to that more
legitimate source of romance, the traditions
common among the people.</p>

<p>From the opening chapter, in which Wallace
is described as an outlaw because he had refused
to take the oath of allegiance to an English
king, to his death in London and the final
crowning of Bruce, there is not a dull page.
Especially interesting is the scene between
William Wallace and the Earl of Carrick, after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
the battle of Falkirk, and the appearance of
Robert Bruce, who overheard this conversation,
fighting by the side of Wallace. The truth of
this incident has been denied, but it is related
by Blind Harry. The trial of William Wallace
in the great hall at Westminster for treason,
and his defence that he had never acknowledged
the English government, is most impressive,
and is a matter of record.</p>

<p><i>The Scottish Chiefs</i> is the first historical novel
in which the author made diligent research in
order to give a truthful representation of the
times. It has the atmosphere of feudal days.
Notwithstanding the ridicule cast upon Wallace
as a lady's hero, he is drawn in heroic proportions.
Miss Mitford declared that she scarcely
knew "one <i>her&oacute;s de roman</i> whom it is possible
to admire, except Wallace in Miss Porter's
story." The work is written in the style of
the old epics. The many puerile attempts of
the last few years to write an historical romance
in which Washington or Lincoln should figure
have shown how difficult is the task. How
weak and commonplace have these great men
appeared in fiction! It requires a nature akin
to the heroic to draw it. In 1810, when it was
published, <i>The Scottish Chiefs</i> was the only
great historical romance. Four years later
<i>Waverley</i> was published, the first of the novels
of Sir Walter Scott. This was superior in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
imagination and in craftsmanship to Miss Porter's
novel, but not in interest. <i>The Scottish
Chiefs</i> has since been excelled by many others
of the Waverley novels, though not by all, by
<i>Henry Esmond</i>, and <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>, but
it preceded all these in time, and still holds a
place as a classic of the second rank.</p>

<p>Critics of to-day smile at its enthusiastic
style, but Miss Porter speaks with no more
enthusiasm than did the poor folk from whom
she heard the story. As long as enthusiastic
youth loves an unblemished hero, <i>The Scottish
Chiefs</i> will be read. It is impossible to analyse
these early impressions or to test their truth.
One can only remember them with gratitude.
Jane Porter has, however, taught the youth
of other lands to reverence Scotland's popular
hero, so that the mention of his name awakens
a thrill of pleasure, and the hills and glades
associated with his deeds glow with the light of
romance.</p>

<p>In 1815, Jane Porter wrote a third historical
novel, <i>The Pastor's Fireside</i>. This is far inferior
to <i>The Scottish Chiefs</i>. It has the same
elevated style, and the mystery which surrounds
the hero awakens and holds the attention.
But the novel deals with the later Stuarts, and
one feels that the author herself was but little
interested in the historical events about which she
was writing. The book has no abiding qualities.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1832 was published a book bearing the
title <i>Sir Edward Seaward's Narrative of His
Shipwreck and Consequent Discovery of certain
Islands in the Caribbean Sea, with a Detail of
many extraordinary and highly interesting Events
in his Life from the year 1733 to 1749 as written
in his Own Diary. Edited by Jane Porter.</i> In
the preface Miss Porter explains how the manuscript
was given to her by the relatives of Sir
Edward. The story reads like a second Robinson
Crusoe. It has all the minute details that
give an air of verisimilitude to the writings
of Defoe. In the opening chapter, Edward
Seaward supposedly gives this account of
himself:</p>

<p>"Born of loyal and honest parents, whose
means were just sufficient to give a common
education to their children, I have neither to
boast of pedigree nor of learning; yet they bequeathed
to me a better inheritance&mdash;a stout
constitution, a peaceable disposition, and a
proper sense of what is due to my superiors
and equals; for such an inheritance I am grateful
to God, and to them."</p>

<p>In the story he is married to a woman of his
own rank, and she embarks with him for Jamaica,
but they are shipwrecked on an island
near Lat. 14 deg. 30 min. N. and Long. 81
deg. W. They find bags of money hidden on
the island, some negroes come to them, and a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
schooner is driven to their haven. Edward
sees in this a purpose which afterward is fulfilled.
He says to his wife: "I should be the
most ungrateful of men, to the good God who
has bestowed all this on me, if I did not feel
that this money, so wonderfully delivered into
my hands, was for some special purpose of stewardship.
The providential arrival of the poor
castaway negroes, and then of the schooner,&mdash;all&mdash;all
working together to give us the means
of providing every comfort, towards planting
a colony of refuge in that blessed haven of our
own preservation,&mdash;seem to me, in solemn
truth, as so many signs from the Divine Will,
that it is our duty to fulfil a task allotted to us,
in that long unknown island."</p>

<p>This island becomes inhabited by a happy
people, and Seaward is knighted by George
the Second.</p>

<p>Everybody read the book. A second edition
was called for within the year. Old naval
officers got out their charts, and hunted up
the probable locality of the places mentioned.
Nobody at first doubted its veracity. The
<i>Quarterly</i>, however, decided that no such man
had ever existed and that the whole story was
a fiction. It hunted for a schooner mentioned
and the names of the naval officers. The latter
had never served in his Majesty's navy and the
former had not timed her voyages according to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
the story. The uniform of a naval officer
described in the narrative was not worn until
thirteen years after these adventures had taken
place, and no man by the name of Seaward had
been knighted during this time, nor was there
any village in England having the name of the
village which he gave as his birthplace. Supposing
the editor had changed names and dates,
the <i>Quarterly</i> criticism becomes valueless. Although
the magazine declared it a work of
fiction, it gave both the story and the style
high praise, and declared it far superior to her
romances. When Miss Porter was asked about
it, she declined to answer, but said that Scott
had his great secret and she might be permitted
to have her little one.</p>

<p>It is generally considered now to have been
the work of Jane Porter. No two books differ
more in style than <i>The Scottish Chiefs</i> and
<i>Sir Edward Seaward</i>. But twenty-two years
had elapsed between them. The former is
written in dignified, stately language; the latter
in simple homely words, and both its invention
and its style entitle it to a place among English
classics.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>

<h2>Amelia Opie. Mary Brunton</h2>

<p>Every novel that touches upon the life
of its generation naturally in course of
time becomes historical. These novels should
be preserved, not necessarily for their literary
excellence, but because they bear the imprint
of an age. Such are the novels of Amelia Opie
and Mary Brunton.</p>

<p>Mrs. Opie, then Miss Alderson, left her quiet
home in Norwich to visit London at the height
of the furor occasioned by the French Revolution.
The literary circles in which she was
received were discussing excitedly the rights of
men and women, and the beauties of life lived
according to the dictates of nature. Among
these enthusiasts, Miss Alderson met Mary Wollstonecraft,
the author of <i>Vindication of the
Rights of Woman</i>, and esteemed her highly.
Her own imagination did not, however, yield
to the intoxication of a life of perfect freedom,
a dream which wrecked the life of Mary Wollstonecraft.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>There is no sadder biography than that of
Mary Wollstonecraft. In Paris, she met Gilbert
Imlay, an American, with whom she fell in
love. When he wished to marry her, she refused
to permit him to make her his wife, because she
had family debts to pay, and she was unwilling
to have him legally responsible for them. But
she had read the books of Rousseau, and had
been deeply impressed with the thought that
marriage is a bondage, not needed by true love.
She took the name of Imlay, and passed for his
wife, but the marriage was not sanctioned
either by the church or by law. After the birth
of a daughter, Imlay deserted her. At first
she tried to commit suicide, and there is the
sad picture of this talented woman walking
about in the drenching rain, and then throwing
herself from the bridge at Putney. She was
rescued, and a little over a year later became
the wife of William Godwin.</p>

<p>The life-story of Mary Wollstonecraft suggested
to Amelia Opie the novel of <i>Adeline
Mowbray, or the Mother and Daughter</i>, which
was not written until after the death of the
original.</p>

<p>It is a tender pathetic story. Mrs. Mowbray,
the mother of Adeline, believed by her neighbours
to be a genius, is interested in new theories
of education, and, while writing a book on that
subject, occasionally experiments with Adeline,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
although she neglects her for the most part.
In spite of this Adeline grows up beautiful and
pure, totally ignorant of the world and its
wickedness. Her mother often quoted in her
presence the book of a Mr. Glenmurray, in
which he proves marriage to be a tyranny and
a profanation of the sacred ties of love. Adeline
is captivated by the enthusiastic ideals
of the young author. There is a fine contrast
in character and motive, where Adeline is entertaining
Mr. Glenmurray, the high-minded writer,
and Sir Patrick O'Carrol, a man of many gallantries.
Sir Patrick is shocked to meet at her
home the man whose theories have banished
him from respectable society. Adeline, innocent
of any low interpretation that may be put
upon her words, makes the frank avowal that,
in her opinion, marriage is a shameless tie, and
that love and honour are all that should bind
men and women. Sir Patrick heartily agrees
with her sentiments, and as a consequence
accosts her with a freedom repugnant to her,
although she hardly understands its import,
while Glenmurray sits by gloomily, resolving
to warn her in private that the opinions she
had expressed were better confined in the
present dark state of the public mind to a select
and discriminating circle. After they leave
Adeline, Glenmurray, as the outcome of this
meeting, had the satisfaction of fighting a duel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
with Sir Patrick, contrary to the tenets of his
own book.</p>

<p>But when, to escape the advances of Sir
Patrick, Adeline places herself under the protection
of Glenmurray, who ardently loves her,
he urges her to marry him. This she refuses
to do, and encourages him to show the world
the truth and beauty of his teachings. Glenmurray,
a man of sensitive nature, suffers more
than Adeline from the indignities she constantly
receives when she frankly says she is
Mr. Glenmurray's companion, not his wife.
He takes her from place to place to avoid them,
for he realises that the world censures her, while
it excuses him. But Adeline is so happy in her
love for him, and in her faith in his teachings,
that she endures every humiliation with the
faith of the early Christian martyrs. When
he urges her, as he so often does, to marry him,
he reads in her eyes only grief that he will not
gladly suffer for what he believes to be right,
and desists rather than pain her. But his death
is hastened by the harassing thought that her
whole future is blighted by his teachings. As
he says to her just before his death:</p>

<p>"Had not I, with the heedless vanity of
youth, given to the world the crude conceptions
of four-and-twenty, you might at this moment
have been the idol of a respectable society; and
I, equally respected, have been the husband<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
of your heart; while happiness would perhaps
have kept that fatal disease at bay, of which
anxiety has facilitated the approach."</p>

<p>It is a beautiful love story, but the hero and
heroine were of too fine a fibre to stand alone
against the world. After the death of Glenmurray,
the interest flags. The conclusion is
weak, not at all worthy of the beginning. Love
of every variety has been the theme of poets
and novelists, but there is no love story more
beautiful for its self-sacrificing devotion to
principle and to each other, than the few pages
of this novel which tell of the unsanctioned
married life of the high-minded idealist and
his bride.</p>

<p>Mrs. Opie wrote <i>Simple Tales</i> and <i>Tales of
Real Life</i>. They are for the most part pathetic
stories in which unhappiness in the family
circle is caused either by undue sternness of a
parent, the unfilial conduct of a son or daughter,
or a misunderstanding between husband and
wife. The feelings of the characters are often
minutely described. A firm faith in the underlying
goodness of human nature is shown
throughout all these tales, and all teach love
and forbearance.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Mary Brunton like Mrs. Opie wrote to improve
the ethical ideals of her generation. In the books
of that day the theory was often advanced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
that young men must sow their wild oats, and
that men were more pleasing to the ladies for
a few vices. Her first novel, <i>Self-Control</i>, was
written to contradict this doctrine. In a letter
to Joanna Baillie, Mrs. Brunton wrote:</p>

<p>"I merely intended to show the power of the
religious principle in bestowing self-command,
and to bear testimony against a maxim as
immoral as indelicate, that a reformed rake
makes the best husband."</p>

<p>Laura, the heroine of <i>Self-Control</i>, ardently
loved a man of rank and fashion. When she
learned of his amours, her love turned first to
grief, then to disgust. Stung by her abhorrence,
he attempted to seduce her to conquer her pride.
The purity of the heroine triumphs. She meets
a man whom she esteems and afterwards
marries. Many of Laura's adventures border
on the improbable, but her emotions are truthfully
depicted.</p>

<p>This was a bolder novel than appears on the
surface. Long before this the wicked heroine
had been banished from fiction. The leading
lady must be virtuous to keep the love of the
hero. Richardson laid down that law of the
novel. Mary Brunton asserted the same rule
for the hero, and maintained that a gentleman,
handsome, noble, accomplished, could not retain
the love of a pure woman, if he were not
virtuous.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>The book gave rise to heated discussions.
Two gentlemen had a violent dispute over it:
one said it ought to be burnt by the common
hangman; the other, that it ought to be written
in letters of gold. Beyond its ethical import,
the novel has no literary value.</p>

<p>The kind reception given to <i>Self-Control</i> led
the author to begin her second novel, <i>Discipline</i>.
This was intended to show how the mind must
be trained by suffering before it can hope for
true enjoyment when self-control is lacking.
Mary Brunton had read Miss Edgeworth's
description of the Irish people with pleasure;
so she planned to set forth in this novel the
manners of the Scottish Highlands and of the
Orkneys, where she herself had been born.
But before it was finished, <i>Waverley</i> was published.
There the Scottish Highlands stood
forth on a large canvas, distinct and truthful,
and Mrs. Brunton realised at once how weak
her own attempts were compared with Scott's
masterly work. Her interest in her book
flagged, although it was published in December
of that year. Some of the Highland scenes
are interesting because accurately described,
and her account of a mad-house in Edinburgh
is said to be an exact representation of an
asylum for the insane in that city.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brunton died before her third novel,
<i>Emmeline</i>, was finished. Her husband, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
Reverend Alexander Brunton, professor of
Oriental Languages at Edinburgh University,
published the fragment of it with her memoirs
after her death. The aim of this novel was to
show how little chance of happiness there is
when a divorced woman marries her seducer.
It only shows the inability of Emmeline to
live down her past shame and the unhappiness
which follows the married pair.</p>

<p>In the novels of Mrs. Opie and Mary Brunton
the standard of conduct is the same as to-day.
Both men and women are expected to lead
upright lives, with true regard for the happiness
of those about them. In <i>Self-Control</i> the hero
refuses to fight a duel with the villain who
has injured him, and forgives him with a true
Christian spirit. To be sure, there are still
seductions, and the world of fashion is without
a heart. But conduct which the former generation
would have regarded with a smile is here
denominated <span class="smcap">sin</span>, and that which they named
Prudery shines forth as <span class="smcap">virtue</span>. The problems
of life which these novels discuss are the
same, as we have said, which agitate the world
to-day.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X</h3>

<h2>Jane Austen</h2>


<p>If in this age of steam and electricity you
would escape from the noise of the city,
and experience for an hour the quiet joys of the
English countryside, at a time when a chaise
and four was the quickest means of reaching the
metropolis from any part of the kingdom, turn
to the pages of Jane Austen. In them have been
preserved faithful pictures of the peaceful life
of the south of England exactly as it existed
a hundred and more years ago. The gently sloping
downs crossed by hedgerows, the lazy rivers
meandering through the valleys, the little villages
half hidden in the orchards of apple, pear,
peach, and plum, all suggest the land of happy
homes. On the outskirts of every village there
are the two of three gentlemen's houses: the
substantial mansion of the squire, with its park
of old elms, oaks, and beeches; a smaller house
suitable for a gentleman of slender income, like
Mr. Bennet, the father of the four girls of <i>Pride
and Prejudice</i>, or for an elder son who will in
time take possession of the hall, like Charles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
Musgrove in the story of <i>Persuasion</i>; and the
still smaller parsonage standing in the garden
of vegetables and flowers, surrounded by a
laurel hedge, where lives a younger son or a
friend of the family.</p>

<p>The gentry that inhabit these homes carry
on the plot of Jane Austen's novels. And what
an even, almost uneventful life they lead. Life
with them is one long holiday. Dance follows
dance, varied only by a dinner at the mansion,
a picnic party, private theatricals, a brief
sojourn at Bath, a briefer one in London, or a
ride to Lyme, seventeen miles away. But Cupid
ever hovers near, and in each one of these groups
of gentle folk we watch the course of true love,
"which never did run smooth." For in spite
of match-making mammas and stern fathers
with an eye that the marriage settlements shall
be sufficient to clothe sentiment with true
British respectability, the six novels of Jane
Austen contain as many true and tender love
stories, differing from one another not so much
in the incidents as in the characters of the lovers.
Unlike the older novelists, who constantly drew
the attention away from the main theme by
stories of thrilling adventure, Jane Austen holds
closely to the great problem of fiction, whether
or not the youths and maidens will be happily
married at the conclusion of the book.</p>

<p>When Darcy first meets Elizabeth, the heroine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>, he shuns her and her
family as vulgar. Elizabeth is so prejudiced
against him that she cannot forget his insulting
arrogance. But Darcy's love cannot be
stemmed. Other heroes have plunged into
raging floods to rescue the fair heroine. Darcy
does more. For love of Elizabeth he accepts
the whole Bennet family, including Mrs. Bennet,
who always says the silly thing, and Lydia, who
had almost invited Wickham to elope with her
and was indifferent as to whether or not he
married her, until Darcy compelled him to do so&mdash;a
bitter humiliation for a man whose greatest
fault was overweening pride of birth. At
last, Elizabeth comprehends the extent of his
generosity, his superior understanding and
strength of character, and Darcy is rewarded
by the hand of the sunniest heroine in all fiction.
Who but Elizabeth with her independent spirit,
quick intelligence and lively wit could curb his
family pride! They marry, and we know they
will be happy.</p>

<p><i>Sense and Sensibility</i> works out a problem
for lovers. Like many romantic girls, Marianne
asserts that a woman can love but once. "He
never loved that loved not at first sight" is also
part of her creed. But after her infatuation for
Willoughby has been cured, she contentedly
marries Colonel Brandon, although she knows
that he frequently has rheumatism and wears<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
flannel waistcoats. Marianne will be much
happier as the wife of a man of mature years
who loves her impulsive nature and can control
it than she would have been with the gallant
who won her first love.</p>

<p>In the piquant satire of <i>Northanger Abbey</i>
there is another problem suggested. This book
is distinctly modern. Man is the pursued;
woman the pursuer. Bernard Shaw has treated
this momentous question in a serious manner
in many of his plays. Jane Austen regards it
with a humorous smile. Did Henry Tilney ever
know why he married Catherine Morland? Or
was this daughter of a country parsonage, without
beauty, without accomplishments, and
without riches, aware that on her first visit to
Bath she used feminine arts that would have
put Becky Sharp to shame&mdash;who, by the way,
was a little girl at that time&mdash;and would have
made Anne, the knowing heroine of <i>Man and
Superman</i>, green with envy? Yet her arts
consisted simply in following the dictates of
her heart. She fell in love with Henry Tilney;
looked for him whenever she entered the pump-room;
was unhappy if he were absent and expressed
her joy at his approach; saw in him the
paragon of wisdom and looked at every thing with
his eyes. From first ignoring her, he began to
seek her society, and learn the true excellence of
her character. And then Jane Austen explains:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>"I must confess that this affection originated
in nothing better than gratitude; or in other
words, that a persuasion of her partiality for
him had been the only cause of giving her a
serious thought. It is a new circumstance in
romance, I acknowledge, and dreadfully derogatory
of an heroine's dignity, but if it is as new
in common life, the credit of a wild imagination
will be all my own."</p>

<p>But lest we think that Miss Austen is asserting
a rule that women take the initiative in
this matter of love and marriage, it is well to
remember that Darcy first loved Elizabeth
Bennet, and forced her to acknowledge his
worth, and that Colonel Brandon married a
young lady who had formerly supposed him at
the advanced age of thirty-five to be occupied
with thoughts of death rather than of love.</p>

<p>And Mr. Knightley is another hero who fell
in love and waited patiently for its return.
Emma is like Marianne in one respect, she
needed guidance. Almost from childhood the
mistress of her father's house and the first
lady in the society of Highbury, she was threatened
by two evils, "the power of having too
much her own way, and a disposition to think
a little too well of herself." Mr. Knightley,
the elder brother of her elder sister's husband,
is the only person that sees that she is not always
wise and that she is sometimes selfish. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
is the only one that chides her. Emma is interested
in promoting the welfare of all about her,
but she lacks that most feminine quality of
insight, so that her well-meant help, as in the
case of her prot&eacute;g&eacute;e, poor Harriet Smith, is
sometimes productive of evil. And yet Emma
is brave and self-forgetful. Not until she has
schooled herself to think of Mr. Knightley as
married to Harriet, is she aware how much he is
a part of her own life. But this is only another
instance of her blindness. When she learns
that he has loved her with all her faults ever
since she was thirteen, she is very happy. There
is no tumultuous passion in this union, but we
are assured of a love that will abide through the
years.</p>

<p>In <i>Mansfield Park</i> and in <i>Persuasion</i>, there is
another variety of the old story. Fanny Price
and Anne Elliot, the one the daughter of a poor
lieutenant of marines, whose family is the most
ill-bred in all Miss Austen's books, the other
the neglected daughter of Sir Walter Elliot,
Baronet, have more in common than any other
of her heroines. Although these stories are
different, yet in each it is the devotion of the
heroine that guides the course of love through
many obstacles into a quiet haven. Who that
reads their story will say that Miss Austen's
maidens are without passion? They do not
analyse their feelings, nor do they pour them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
forth in wild soliloquy. But the heart of each
is clearly revealed through little acts and
expressions. Fanny Price, cherishing a love
for Edmund Bertram, who was kind to her
when she was neglected by everybody else, refuses
to marry the rich, handsome, and brilliant
Mr. Crawford, although she herself is penniless.
We feel her misery as she realises that she is
nothing but a friend to Edmund and rejoice
with her when her love awakens a response.
Anne Elliot, the gentlest of all her heroines,
who in obedience to her father has broken her
engagement to Captain Wentworth eight years
before, when she is again thrown into his company,
observes his every expression, and grows
sad and weak in health at his studied neglect.
Other heroines have said more, but none have
felt more than Miss Austen's. Anne Elliot herself
has spoken for them:</p>

<p>"All the privilege I claim for my own sex
(it is not a very enviable one) is that of loving
longest, when existence, or when hope, is gone."</p>

<p>But Jane Austen, like Shakespeare, is a dramatist.
So, lest this be taken for Miss Austen's
opinion, Captain Wentworth has the last word
here when he writes to Anne, "Dare not say
that man forgets sooner than woman, that his
love has an earlier death. Unjust I have been,
weak and resentful I have been, but never
inconstant."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>And so, at the close of these novels, two more
happy homes are added to those of rural England.</p>

<p>Are there many heroes and heroines for whom
we dare predict a happy married life? Would
Mr. B. and Pamela have written such long letters
to each other about the training of their
children if conversation had not been a bore?
Evelina must have been disappointed to discover
that Lord Orville lived on roast beef,
plum-pudding, and port wine instead of music
and poetry. Of all Scott's heroes and heroines
none had sacrificed more for each other than
Ivanhoe and Rowena; he gave up Rotherwood,
and, as a disinherited son, sought forgetfulness
of her charms in distant Palestine; she put
aside all hopes of becoming a Saxon queen, and
was true to the gallant son of Cedric. Yet we
have Thackeray for authority that they were
not only unhappy, but often quarrelled after
Scott left them at the altar. And none of
Thackeray's marriages turned out well, although
Becky Sharp made Rodney Crawley very happy
until he discovered her wiles. Dickens was
perhaps more fortunate, but David was led
away by the cunning ways of Dora before he
discovered a companion and helpmate in Agnes,
a heroine worthy to be placed beside Elizabeth
and Jane Bennet. George Eliot's books and
those of later novelists are rather a warning
than an incentive to matrimony. Have all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
our sighs and tears over the mishaps of ill-starred
lovers been in vain, and is it true that
when the curtain falls at the wedding it is only
to shut from view a scene of domestic infelicity?</p>

<p>Not so with Jane Austen. She is the queen
of match-makers. The marriages brought about
by her guidance give a belief in the permanency
of English home life, quite as necessary for
the welfare of the kingdom as the stability of
Magna Charta. Her heroes have qualities that
wear well, and her heroines might have inspired
Wordsworth's lines:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
A creature not too bright or good<br />
For human nature's daily food,<br />
For transient sorrows, simple wiles,<br />
Praise, blame, love, kisses, tears and smiles.<br />
</p></div>

<p>Besides the lovers, many diverting people
lived in these homes of the gentry, quite as
amusing as any of the peasants who were
brought upon the stage by the older dramatists
for our entertainment; perhaps more amusing,
because of their self-sufficiency. These people
seldom do anything that is peculiar, nor are
they the objects of practical jokes, as were so
many men and women in the earlier books; but
they talk freely both at home and abroad about
whatever is of interest to them. They seldom
use stereotyped words or phrases, yet their
conversation is a crystal from which the whole
mental horizon of the speaker shines forth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
When Mrs. Bennet learns that Netherfield Park
has been let to a single gentleman of fortune,
her first exclamation comes from the heart&mdash;"What
a fine thing for our girls!" After Mr.
Collins, upon whom Mr. Bennet's estate is entailed,
has resolved to make all possible amends
to his daughters by marrying one of them, and
is making his famous proposal to Elizabeth, he
says with solemn composure: "But, before I
am run away with by my feelings on this subject,
perhaps it would be advisable for me to state
my reasons for marrying&mdash;and, moreover, for
coming into Hertfordshire with the design of
selecting a wife, as I certainly did." No wonder
Elizabeth laughed at such a lover. Mr.
Collins is the same type of man as Mr. Smith,
whom Evelina meets at Snow Hill, but infinitely
more ridiculous because he is an educated man
of some attainments.</p>

<p>Then there is Mr. Woodhouse, the father of
Emma, with his constant solicitude for everybody's
health and his fears that they may have
indigestion. When his daughter and her family
arrive from London, all well and hearty, he
says by way of hospitality: "You and I will
have a nice basin of gruel together. My dear
Emma, suppose we all have a basin of gruel."
His friend Mrs. Bates is always voluble. She
is describing Mr. Dixon's country seat in Ireland
to Emma: "Jane has heard a great deal of its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
beauty&mdash;from Mr. Dixon, I mean&mdash;I do not
know that she ever heard about it from anybody
else&mdash;but it was very natural, you know, that
he should like to speak of his own place while
he was paying his addresses&mdash;and as Jane used
to be very often walking out with them&mdash;for
Colonel and Mrs. Campbell were very particular
about their daughter's not walking out often
with only Mr. Dixon, for which I do not at all
blame them; of course she heard everything he
might be telling Miss Campbell about his own
home in Ireland." One respects the mental
power of a woman who could remember the
main thread of her discourse amid so many
digressions.</p>

<p>How characteristic is Sir Walter Elliot's reply
to the gentleman who is trying to bring a neighbour's
name to his mind. "Wentworth? Oh,
ay! Mr. Wentworth, the curate of Monkford.
You misled me by the term <i>Gentleman</i>. I
thought you were speaking of some man of
property." And not the least amusing of these
people is Mr. Elton's bride, a pert sort of woman
who for some reason patronises everybody
into whose company she is thrown. After
meeting Mr. Knightley, by far the most consequential
person about Highbury, she expresses
her approval of him to Emma: "Knightley is
quite the gentleman! I like him very much!
Decidedly, I think, a very gentlemanlike man."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
And Emma wonders if Mr. Knightley has been
able to pronounce this self-important newcomer
as quite the lady. Pick out almost any
speech at random, and anyone who is at all
familiar with Miss Austen will easily recognise
the speaker.</p>

<p>This ability to describe people by such delicate
touches has been highly praised by Macaulay
in the essay on Madame D'Arblay before
quoted. He thus compares Jane Austen with
Shakespeare:</p>

<p>"Admirable as he [Shakespeare] was in all
parts of his art, we must admire him for this,
that, while he has left us a greater number of
striking portraits than all other dramatists
put together, he has scarcely left us a single
caricature. Shakespeare has had neither equal
nor second. But among the writers who, in
the point which we have mentioned, have approached
nearest to the manner of the great
master, we have no hesitation in placing Jane
Austen, a woman of whom England is justly
proud. She has given us a multitude of characters,
all, in a certain sense, commonplace, all
such as we meet every day. Yet they are all
as perfectly discriminated from each other
as if they were the most eccentric of human
beings. There are, for instance, four clergymen,
none of whom we should be surprised
to find in any parsonage in the kingdom, Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
Edward Ferrars, Mr. Henry Tilney, Mr. Edmund
Bertram, and Mr. Elton. They are all
specimens of the upper part of the middle
class. They have all been liberally educated.
They all lie under the restraints of the same
sacred profession. They are all young. They
are all in love. Not one of them has any hobbyhorse,
to use the phrase of Sterne. Not one
has a ruling passion, such as we read of in Pope.
Who would not have expected them to be insipid
likenesses of each other? No such thing.
Harpagon is not more unlike to Jourdain,
Joseph Surface is not more unlike to Sir Lucius
O'Trigger, than every one of Miss Austen's
young divines to his reverend brethren. And
almost all this is done by touches so delicate
that they elude analysis, that they defy the
powers of description, and that we know them
to exist only by the general effect to which they
have contributed."</p>

<p>Like Shakespeare Jane Austen knew the
inner nature by intuition, and had learned its
outward expression by observation. Character
not only affects the speech of each one of her
men and women, but determines their destiny
and shapes the plot of the story. The class she
has chosen to represent is the least under the
sway of circumstances of any in England.
With money for all needs, and leisure for enjoyment,
free from obligations which pertain to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
higher rank, character here develops freely and
naturally. Not one of the matchmaking men
or women, not even the intelligent Emma, succeeds
in changing the life of those whom they
attempt to influence. Character is stronger
than any outside agency. In this respect, Jane
Austen is decidedly at variance with Thomas
Hardy or Tolstoi, but she is at one with
Shakespeare.</p>

<p>In the opening paragraph of each book,
character begins to assert itself. If Darcy
had been without <small>PRIDE</small>, and Elizabeth had
been without <small>PREJUDICE</small>; if Marianne had had
her sensibilities under control; if Emma had not
been blind; if Captain Wentworth had not
been unjust and resentful&mdash;there would have
been no story to tell, the course of true love
would have run so smooth. But all of them
are loving and faithful, and these qualities in
the end conquer, and bring the stories to a
happy conclusion.</p>

<p>Edmund Gosse thus writes of her delineation
of character:</p>

<p>"Like Balzac, like Tourgenieff at his best,
Jane Austen gives the reader an impression of
knowing everything there was to know about
her creations, of being incapable of error as to
their acts, thoughts, or emotions. She presents
an absolute illusion of reality; she exhibits an
art so consummate that we mistake it for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
nature. She never mixes her own temperament
with those of her characters, she is never swayed
by them, she never loses for a moment her
perfect, serene control of them. Among the
creators of the world, Jane Austen takes a place
that is with the highest and that is purely her
own."</p>

<p>This seeming control of her characters is due
largely to the fact that whatever happens to
them is just what might have been expected.
This is particularly true of the bad people she
has created. Innocence led astray has been a
popular means of exciting interest ever since
Richardson told the sad story of Clarissa Harlowe.
But there is no such incident in Jane
Austen's books. Lydia, who hasn't a thought
for anybody nor anything but a red-coat, and
Wickham, who elopes with her without any
intention of matrimony, are properly punished,
by being married to each other, and the future
unhappiness which must be their lot is due to
their own natures. Willoughby had seduced
one girl, trifled with the affections of another,
and married an heiress, but he finds only misery,
and sadly says: "I must rub through the world
as well as I can." Henry Crawford, and his
sister, with so much that is good in their natures,
yet with a lack of moral fibre, are both unhappy.
Each has lost the one they respected and loved
and might have married. With what wit she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
leaves William Elliot, the all-agreeable man,
the heir of Sir Walter, who, that he may keep
the latter single, has enticed the scheming Mrs.
Clay from his home:</p>

<p>"And it is now a doubtful point whether his
cunning or hers may finally carry the day;
whether, after preventing her from being the
wife of Sir Walter, he may not be wheedled
and caressed at last into making her the wife
of Sir William."</p>

<p>And so punishment is meted out with that
nicety of judgment which distinguishes every
detail of her novels.</p>

<p>But Jane Austen has little interest in immorality.
"Let other pens dwell on guilt and
misery; I quit such odious subjects as soon as
I can," she says in <i>Mansfield Park</i>. And her
readers have observed that deeds of evil take
place off the stage, while she records only what
is reported of them in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>She dwells as little on misery as on guilt. She
shows in her letters charitable regard for the
poor people of Steventon and Chawton. She
describes minutely the unkempt house of
Lieutenant Price at Portsmouth with its incessant
noise of heavy steps, banging doors,
and untrained servants, where every voice was
loud excepting Mrs. Price's, which resembled
"the soft monotony of Lady Bertram's, only
worn into fretfulness." Miss Austen's pen was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
able to portray scenes of squalor and vice;
she chose to turn from them. Perhaps she felt
instinctively that true &aelig;sthetic pleasure cannot
be produced by dwelling on a scene in a
book which would be repulsive to the eye.
Miss Austen wrote before there was much
serious interest in the lives of the poor. Their
only function in literature had been to provoke
laughter. The sensitive daughter of the rector
of Steventon may have felt, as others have,
that there was no occasion to laugh at the
blunders and ill-manners of peasants, which
were proper and natural to their condition of
life. She did not need these people to entertain
us. There were quite as funny people in the
hall as in the cottage, funnier, even, because
their humorous sayings spring from a humorous
twist in their natures, not from ignorance.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott, after reading <i>Pride and
Prejudice</i> for the third time, said:</p>

<p>"That young lady had a talent for describing
the involvements and feelings and characters
of ordinary life, which is to me the most wonderful
I ever met with. The Big Bow-wow
strain I can do myself, like any now going; but
the exquisite touch, which renders ordinary
commonplace things and characters interesting
from the truth of the description and the sentiment,
is denied to me."</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott proved the truth of the above<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
statement in <i>St. Ronan's Well</i>, one of the least
successful of his novels, which was written in
imitation of Jane Austen.</p>

<p>Because Jane Austen confined her work so
closely to ordinary middle-class people, she has
been called narrow. But if we judge men and
women not by dress and manners, but by what
they are, these people furnish as broad a view
of humanity as could be obtained by travelling
up and down the world. A trained botanist
will gather an herbarium from a country lane
that will give a more extended knowledge of
botany than a less skilful one could get by
travelling through the woods and fields of a
continent. Very few novelists have portrayed
greater varieties of human nature than Miss
Austen.</p>

<p>Jane Austen's style has been praised by all
critics. George William Curtis wrote of her
art:</p>

<p>"She writes wholly as an artist, while George
Eliot advocates views, and Miss Bront&euml;'s fiery
page is often a personal protest. In Miss Austen,
on the other hand, there is in kind, but infinitely
less in degree, the same clear atmosphere of
pure art which we perceive in Shakespeare and
Goethe."</p>

<p>While Miss Austen has been so often likened
to Shakespeare, she is in no sense a romantic
writer. She belongs purely to the classic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
school. She has the restraint, the perfect poise
of the Greeks. She recognises everywhere the
need of law. She accepts society as it exists
under the restraints of law and religion. She
no more questioned the English prayer book
and the English constitution than Homer questioned
the existence of the gods and the supreme
power of kings. This feeling for law shaped
her art. Her plots are perfectly symmetrical.
There is no redundancy in expression. There
is none of that wild luxuriance in fancy or expression
so common in romanticism. Each
word used is needed in the sentence, and is in
its proper place. The strength of romanticism
lies in its impetuosity; the strength of classicism
lies in its self-control. This is the strength of
Jane Austen.</p>

<p>Emotion in her books is so restrained that
the superficial reader doubts its existence.
Yet her characters feel deeply and are sensitive
to the acts and words of those about them.
Although their feelings are under control, they
are none the less real. The reader watches, but
is not asked to participate in their griefs.</p>

<p>As she never moves to tears, neither does she
provoke laughter, but she lightens every page
with a quiet glow of humour. Humour was as
natural to her as to Elizabeth Bennet, whose
sayings give the sparkle to <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>.
Much of the humour in her letters consists of an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
unexpected turn to a sentence or an incongruous
combination of words. She writes of
meeting "Dr. Hall in such very deep mourning
that either his mother, his wife or himself must
be dead." She announces the marriage of a
gentleman to a widow by the laconic message,
"Dr. Gardiner was married yesterday to Mrs.
Percy and her three daughters." And again
she says that a certain Mrs. Blount appeared
the same as in September, "with the same broad
face, diamond bandeau, white shoes, pink
husband, and fat neck." She sees through the
affectations of society and observes the pleasure
afforded by the small misfortunes of another as
plainly as did Thackeray later. The wife of a
certain gentleman is discovered "to be everything
the neighbourhood could wish, silly and
cross as well as extravagant." She finds continual
source of enjoyment in people's foibles,
and thinks that her own misfortunes ought to
furnish jokes to her acquaintances, or she will
die in their debt for entertainment.</p>

<p>In a less refined degree, this was the view of
life of Miss Burney, her favourite author. Miss
Austen was but three years old when Evelina
made her d&eacute;but at Ranelagh, and not over
seven when Cecilia visited her three guardians
in London: <i>Camilla</i> was published in the year
that it is thought that Miss Austen began <i>Pride
and Prejudice</i>. During these years, Miss Bur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>ney's
fame was undimmed. Consider yourself
for a moment in a circulating library, in the
year 1797 or 1798, suppose you are fond of
novel reading, and have moreover the refined
tastes of Miss Austen; you will find there no
novelist who can hold a rival place to Miss
Burney. Miss Austen refers to her both in her
novels and letters. In only one passage in her
novels has she interrupted her story to express
a general opinion; that is in <i>Northanger Abbey</i>,
where she praises the art of the novelist, and
refers particularly to <i>Cecilia</i>, <i>Camilla</i>, and
<i>Belinda</i>. In the same novel John Thorpe's lack
of taste is emphasised by his calling <i>Camilla</i>
a stupid book of unnatural stuff, which he could
not get through. She evidently discussed Miss
Burney's novels with the people she met; a
certain young man just entered at Oxford has
heard that <i>Evelina</i> was written by Dr. Johnson,
and she finds two traits in a certain Miss Fletcher
very pleasing: "She admires <i>Camilla</i>, and drinks
no cream in her tea." But Miss Austen was no
blind disciple of Miss Burney. All the odd
characters which Miss Burney culled from the
lower ranks of society were swept away by
Miss Austen. Everything approaching tragedy
or the improbable is avoided, but what is left
is amplified and refined until there is no more
trace of Miss Burney than there is of Perugino
in the paintings of Raphael.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>Artists in other lines have striven in their
work for a unified whole. Most novelists have
been more intent on pointing a moral or producing
a sensation than on the technique of
their writing. Their works as a whole lack
proportion. They obtrude unnecessarily in one
part and are weak in another. Miss Austen
wrote because the characters in her brain demanded
expression. Who could remain silent
with Elizabeth Bennet urging her to utterance?
She wrote with the greatest care because she
could do nothing slovenly. Whatever place
may be assigned to her as the years go by, her
novels surpass all others written in English in
their perfect art.</p>

<p>Miss Austen's genius was but slowly recognised.
Her first books were published in 1811,
only three years before <i>Waverley</i>, and her last
novels were published after it. Who will linger
over the teacups while knights in armour
are riding the streets without? It is not until
the cavalcade has passed that home seems again
a quiet, refreshing spot. So the public, tired
of the brilliant scenes and conflicting passions
of other novels, has in the last few years turned
back to the simple, wholesome stories of Jane
Austen.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI</h3>

<h2>Miss Ferrier. Miss Mitford.
Anna Maria Hall</h2>


<p>Walter Scott, the most chivalrous of
all writers, brought to an end woman's
supremacy in the novel, in 1814. At this time
prose fiction was far different from what it was
in 1772, when Tobias Smollet died, and much
of this difference was due to women. Professor
Masson, in his lectures on the novel, gives the
names of twenty novelists who wrote between
1789-1814 who are remembered in the history
of English literature. "With the exception of
Godwin," he writes, "I do not know that any
of the male novelists I have mentioned could
be put in comparison, in respect of genuine
merit, with such novelists of the other sex as
Mrs. Radcliffe, Miss Edgeworth, and Miss Austen."
It is equally worthy of note that, of the
twenty names given, fourteen are women.</p>

<p>Although during these years women had developed
the historical novel, and had brought the
novel of mystery to a high degree of perfection,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
they left the most enduring stamp on literature
as realists, as painters of everyday life and commonplace
people. Francis Jeffrey wrote:</p>

<p>"It required almost the same courage to get
rid of the jargon of fashionable life and the
swarms of peers, foundlings, and seducers, that
infested our modern fables as it did in those
days to sweep away the mythological persons of
antiquity, and to introduce characters who
spoke and acted like those who were to peruse
their adventures."</p>

<p>Women awakened interest in the humdrum
lives of their neighbours next door, and this
without any exaggeration, simply by minute
attention to little things, and quick sympathy
in the joys and sorrows of others. They described
manners and customs; their view of
life was largely objective. It is a noteworthy
fact that while Scott was casting over all Europe
the light of romanticism, the women writers of
the time, with but one or two exceptions, were
viewing life with the clear vision of Miss Edgeworth
and Miss Austen, as if the world obtruded
too glaringly upon their eyes to be lost sight
of in happy day-dreams.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Susan Edmonstone Ferrier is better known
to-day as the friend of Scott, and an occasional
visitor at Abbotsford, than as a successful
novelist. She was born at Edinburgh in 1782,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
where her father, James Ferrier, was Writer to the
Signet, and at one time Clerk of Session, Scott
being one of his colleagues. That great genius
was one of the earliest to appreciate the excellence
of her descriptions of Scottish life given in
her first book, entitled <i>Marriage</i>, published
anonymously in 1818. In the conclusion of the
<i>Tales of my Landlord</i> he paid the unknown
writer this graceful tribute:</p>

<p>"There remains behind not only a large harvest,
but labourers capable of gathering it in;
more than one writer has of late displayed
talents of this description, and if the present
author, himself a phantom, may be permitted to
distinguish a brother, or perhaps a sister, shadow,
he would mention in particular the author of the
very lively work entitled <i>Marriage</i>."</p>

<p>Miss Ferrier wrote but three novels, <i>Marriage</i>,
<i>The Inheritance</i>, and <i>Destiny</i>, a period of six
years intervening between the appearance of
each of them. Like Miss Burney and Miss
Edgeworth she depicts two grades of society.
She shows forth the fashionable life of Edinburgh
and London, and the cruder mode of
living found in the Scottish Highlands. But
between her and her models there is the great
difference of genius and talent. They passed
what they had seen through the alembic of
imagination; she has depicted what she saw
with the faithfulness of the camera, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
crude realism of these scenes does not always
blend with the warp and woof of the story.</p>

<p>Like Miss Edgeworth, Miss Ferrier had a
moral to work out. She treats society as a
satirist, and lays bare its heartlessness, and
the unhappiness of its members who to escape
ennui are led hither and thither by the caprice
of the moment. While she may present one side
of the picture, one hesitates to accept Lady
Juliana, Mrs. St. Clair, or Lady Elizabeth as
common types of a London drawing-room.</p>

<p>Her plots as well as her characters suffer from
this conscious attempt to teach the happiness
that must follow the practice of the Christian
virtues. In <i>Marriage</i> there are two complete
stories. Lady Juliana is the heroine of the
first part; her two daughters, who are born in
the first half, supplant their mother as heroines
of the second half. The plot of <i>Destiny</i> is not
much better. The denouement is tame, and
the characters lack consistency. <i>The Inheritance</i>
has the strongest plot of the three; but
Mrs. St. Clair and her secret interviews with
the monstrosity Lewiston, who, by the way,
has the honour to be an American, throw an
air of unreality over a story in many respects
intensely real. In this story, as in so many old
novels, the nurse's daughter had been brought
up as the rightful heiress. The scene in which
she tells her betrothed lover, the heir of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
estate, the story of her birth, which she had just
learned, is said to have suggested to Tennyson
the beautiful ballad of <i>Lady Clare</i>.</p>

<p>But when Miss Ferrier sees loom in imagination
the sombre purple hills of the Highlands,
with the black tarns in the hollows half-hidden
in mist, her genius awakes. If she had devoted
herself to these people and this region, and
ignored the fashionable life of the cities, she
might have written a book worthy to be placed
beside the best of Miss Edgeworth or Miss
Mitford. At the time she wrote, the Highland
chief no longer summoned his clan about him
at a blast from his bugle, but he had lost little
of his old-time picturesqueness. The opening
of <i>Destiny</i> describes the wealth of the chief of
Glenroy:</p>

<p>"All the world knows that there is nothing on
earth to be compared to a Highland chief. He
has his loch and his islands, his mountains and
his castle, his piper and his tartan, his forests
and his deer, his thousands of acres of untrodden
heath, and his tens of thousands of black-faced
sheep, and his bands of bonneted clansmen,
with claymores and Gaelic, and hot blood and
dirks."</p>

<p>But Miss Ferrier also depicted a more sordid
type of Highlander. Christopher North in his
<i>Noctes Ambrosian&aelig;</i> writes of her novels:</p>

<p>"They are the works of a very clever woman,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
sir, and they have one feature of true and melancholy
interest quite peculiar to themselves.
It is in them alone that the ultimate breaking-down
and debasement of the Highland character
has been depicted. Sir Walter Scott had fixed
the enamel of genius over the last fitful gleams
of their half-savage chivalry, but a humbler and
sadder scene&mdash;the age of lucre-banished clans,&mdash;of
chieftains dwindled into imitation squires,
and of chiefs content to barter the recollections
of a thousand years for a few gaudy seasons
of Almacks and Crockfords, the euthanasia of
kilted aldermen and steamboat pibrochs, was
reserved for Miss Ferrier."</p>

<p>Besides her descriptions of the Highlands,
Miss Ferrier has drawn several Scotch characters
that deserve to live. What a delightful
group is described in <i>Marriage</i>, consisting of the
three Misses Douglas, known as "The girls,"
and their friend Mrs. Maclaughlan! Miss
Jacky Douglas, the senior of the trio, "was
reckoned a woman of sense"; Miss Grizzy was
distinguished by her good-nature and the entanglement
of her thoughts; and it was said
that Miss Nicky was "not wanting for sense
either"; while their friend Lady Maclaughlan
loved and tyrannised over all three of them.
Sir Walter Scott admired the character of
Miss Becky Duguid, a poor old maid, who
"was expected to attend all accouchements,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
christenings, deaths, chestings, and burials, but
she was seldom asked to a marriage, and never
to any party of pleasure." Joanna Baillie
thought the loud-spoken minister, M'Dow, a
true representative of a few of the Scotch clergy
whose only aim is preferment and good cheer.
But none of her other characters can compare
with the devoted Mrs. Molly Macaulay, the
friend of the Chief of Glenroy in <i>Destiny</i>. When
Glenroy has an attack of palsy, she hurries to
him, and when she is told that he has missed
her, she exclaims with perfect self-forgetfulness:</p>

<p>"Deed, and I thought he would do that,
for he has always been so kind to me,&mdash;and
I thought sometimes when I was away, oh,
thinks I to myself, I wonder what Glenroy will
do for somebody to be angry with,&mdash;for Ben-bowie's
grown so deaf, poor creature, it's not
worth his while to be angry at him,&mdash;and you're
so gentle that it would not do for him to be
angry at you; but I'm sure he has a good right
to be angry at me, considering how kind he
has always been to me."</p>

<p>Christopher North said of Molly Macaulay,
"No sinner of our gender could have adequately
filled up the outline."</p>

<p>George Saintsbury, considering the permanent
value of Miss Ferrier's work, wrote for the
<i>Fortnightly Review</i> in 1882:</p>

<p>"Of the four requisites of the novelist, plot,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
character, description, and dialogue, she is only
weak in the first. The lapse of an entire half-century
and a complete change of manners
have put her books to the hardest test they are
ever likely to have to endure, and they come
through it triumphantly."</p>

<p>But, besides the excellences mentioned by
Mr. Saintsbury, Miss Ferrier is master of humour
and pathos. No story is sadder than that of
Ronald Malcolm, the hero of <i>Destiny</i>. He had
been willed the castle of Inch Orran with its
vast estates, but with the provision that he was
to have no benefit from it until his twenty-sixth
year. In case of his death the property was
to go to his father, an upright but poor man.
As Ronald had many years to wait before he
could enjoy his riches, he entered the navy. His
ship was lost at sea and the news of his death
reported in Scotland. But Ronald had been
rescued from the sinking ship, and returned to
his father's cottage. Here he met a purblind
old woman, who told him how his father, Captain
Malcolm, had moved to the castle, and what
good he was doing among his tenantry. She
described the sorrow of the people at the death
of Ronald, but added: "Och! it was God's
providence to tak' the boy out of his worthy
father's way; and noo a' thing 's as it should be,
and he has gotten his ain, honest man; and long,
long may he enjoy it!" And then she said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
thankfully, "The poor lad's death was a great
blessing&mdash;och ay, 'deed was 't." The scene
where Ronald goes to the castle and looks in at
the window upon the happy family group, consisting
of his father and mother, brothers and
sisters, resembles in many particulars the sad
return of Enoch Arden. The close of the scene
is as touching in the novel as in the poem:
"Yes, yes, they are happy, and I am forgotten!"
sobs the lad, as he turns away.</p>

<p>Miss Ferrier, however, seldom touches the
pathetic; she is first of all a humourist. But
there is a blending of the smiles and tears of
human life in the delightful character of Adam
Ramsay. Engaged as a boy to Lizzie Lundie,
he had gone forth into the world to make a
fortune, but when he returned after many years
he found that she had married in his absence,
and soon afterwards had died. Crabbed to all
about him, he still cherished the remembrance
of his early love, and was quickly moved by
any appeal to her memory.</p>

<p>The practical philosophy of the Scottish
peasantry is amusingly set forth in the scene
where Miss St. Clair visits one of the cottages
on Lord Rossville's estate. She found the
goodman very ill, and everything about the
room betokening extreme poverty. When she
offered to send him milk and broth, and a carpet
and chairs to make the room more comfortable,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
his wife interposed, "A suit o' gude bein comfortable
dead claise, Tammes, wad set ye better
than aw the braw chyres an' carpets i' the toon."
Sometime afterward, when Miss St. Clair called
to see how the invalid was, she found him in
the press-bed, while the clothes were warming
before the fire. His wife explained that she
could not have him in the way, and if he were
cold, it could not be helped, as the clothes had
to be aired, and added, "An' I 'm thinkin' he 'll
no be lang o' wantin' them noo."</p>

<p>But notwithstanding her humour, Miss Ferrier
was a stern moralist, whose attitude toward
life had been influenced indirectly by the
teachings of John Knox. She sometimes seems
to stand her characters in the stocks, and call
upon the populace to view their sins or absurdities.
She seldom throws the veil of charity
over them. Men as novelists are prone to
exaggeration. Women have represented life
with greater truth both in its larger aspects and
in details. Miss Ferrier carries this quality to
an extreme. She tells not only the truth, but,
with almost heartless honesty, reveals the whole
of it, so that many of her men and women are
repugnant to the reader while they amuse him.
The best judges of Scottish manners have borne
witness to the exactness of her portraiture.
She is, perhaps, an example of the artistic failure
of over-realism.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>Mary Russell Mitford like Miss Ferrier painted
her scenes and her portraits from real life. But
there is as wide a difference between their
writings as between the rocky ledges of the
Grampian Hills and the soft meadows bathed
in the sunshine which stretch back of the cottages
of Our Village. Miss Mitford's, indeed,
was a sunny nature, not to be hardened nor
embittered by a lifelong anxiety over poverty
and debts. Her father, Dr. Mitford, had spent
nearly all his own fortune when he married
Miss Mary Russell, an heiress. Besides being
constantly involved in lawsuits, he was addicted
to gambling, and soon squandered the fortune
which his wife had brought him, besides twenty
thousand pounds won in a lottery. He is said
to have lost in speculations and at play about
seventy thousand pounds, at that time a large
fortune. The authoress was a little over thirty
years of age when the poverty of the family
forced them to leave Bertram House, their
home for many years, and remove to a little
labourer's cottage about a mile away, on the
principal street of a little village near Reading,
known as Three Mile Cross. Here the support
of the family devolved upon the daughter, a
burden made harder by the continual extravagance
of the father, whom she devotedly loved.
Although she received large sums for her writings,
it is with the greatest weariness that she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
writes to her friend Miss Barrett, afterwards
Mrs. Browning, of the struggles that have been
hers the greater part of her life, the ten or twelve
hours of literary drudgery each day, often in
spite of ill health, and her hope that she may
always provide for her father his accustomed
comforts. Not only was she enabled to do this,
but, through the help of friends, to pay, after his
death, the one thousand pounds indebtedness,
his only legacy to her.</p>

<p>Yet there is not a trace of this worry in the
delightful series of papers called <i>Our Village</i>,
which she began to contribute at this time to
the <i>Lady's Magazine</i>. Before this she had become
known as a poet and a successful playwright,
but had believed herself incapable of
writing good prose. Necessity revealed her
fine power of description, and Three Mile Cross
furnished her with scenes and characters.</p>

<p><i>Our Village</i> marked a new style in fiction.
The year it was commenced, she wrote to a
friend:</p>

<p>"With regard to novels, I should like to see
one undertaken without any plot at all. I do
not mean that it should have no story; but I
should like some writer of luxuriant fancy to
begin with a certain set of characters&mdash;one
family, for instance&mdash;without any preconceived
design farther than one or two incidents or
dialogues, which would naturally suggest fresh<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
matter, and so proceed in this way, throwing
in incidents and characters profusely, but
avoiding all stage tricks and strong situations,
till some death or marriage should afford a
natural conclusion to the book."</p>

<p>Miss Mitford followed this plan as far as her
great love of nature would permit. For when
she found her daily cares too great to be borne
in the little eight-by-eight living-room, she escaped
to the woods and fields. She loved the
poets who wrote of nature, and next to Miss
Austen, whom she placed far above any other
novelist, she delighted in the novels of Charlotte
Smith, and in her own pages there is the same
true feeling for nature.</p>

<p><i>Our Village</i> follows in a few particulars Gilbert
White's <i>History of Selborne</i>. As he described
the beauties of Selborne through the varying
seasons of the year, she describes her walks
about Three Mile Cross, first when the meadows
are covered with hoar frost, then when the air
is perfumed with violets, and later when the
harvest field is yellow with ripened corn. All
the lanes, the favourite banks, the shady recesses
are described with delicate and loving touch.
How her own joyous, optimistic nature speaks
in this record of a morning walk in a backward
spring:</p>

<p>"Cold bright weather. All within doors,
sunny and chilly; all without, windy and dusty,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
It is quite tantalising to see that brilliant sun
careering through so beautiful a sky, and to
feel little more warmth from his presence than
one does from that of his fair but cold sister,
the moon. Even the sky, beautiful as it is, has
the look of that one sometimes sees in a very
bright moonlight night&mdash;deeply, intensely blue,
with white fleecy clouds driven vigorously along
by a strong breeze, now veiling and now exposing
the dazzling luminary around whom
they sail. A beautiful sky! and, in spite of its
coldness, a beautiful world!"</p>

<p>But how naturally we meet the people of the
village and become interested in them. There
is Harriet, the belle of the village, "a flirt
passive," who made the tarts and puddings
in the author's kitchen; Joel Brent, her lover,
a carter by calling, but, by virtue of his personal
accomplishments, the village beau. There is
the publican, the carpenter, the washerwoman;
little Lizzie, the spoilt child, and all the other
boys and girls of the village. It is very natural
to-day to meet these poor people in novels;
at that time the poor people of Ireland and
Scotland had begun to creep into fiction, but
it was as unusual in England as a novel without
a plot. Even to-day Miss Mitford's attitude
toward these people is not common. It seems
never to have occurred to the author, and
certainly does not to her readers, that these men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
dressed in overalls and these women in print
dresses with sleeves rolled to the elbow were
not the finest ladies and gentlemen of the land.
She greets them all with a playful humour
which reminds one of the genial smile of Elia.
C. H. Herford in <i>The Age of Wordsworth</i> wrote
of <i>Our Village</i>:</p>

<p>"No such intimate and sympathetic portrayal
of village life had been given before, and
perhaps it needed a woman's sympathetic eye
for little things to show the way. Of the professional
story-teller on the alert for a sensation
there is as little as of the professional novelist
on the watch for a lesson."</p>

<p><i>Belford Regis</i>, a series of country and town
sketches, was written soon after the completion
of <i>Our Village</i>. Here again is the happy blending
of nature and humanity; the same fusion
of truth and fiction. As Belford Regis is
"Our Market Town," there is a wider range of
characters, as different classes are represented;
and a more intimate view, since the same people
appear in more than one story. Stephen Lane,
the butcher, and his wife are often met with.
He is so fat that "when he walks, he overfills
the pavement, and is more difficult to pass than
a link of full-dressed misses or a chain of becloaked
dandies." Of Mrs. Lane she writes:
"Butcher's wife and butcher's daughter though
she were, yet was she a graceful and gracious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
woman, one of nature's gentlewomen in look
and in thought." There was Miss Savage,
"who was called a sensible woman because
she had a gruff voice and vinegar aspect";
and Miss Steele, who was called literary, because
forty years ago she made a grand poetical
collection. Miss Mitford even does justice to
Mrs. Hollis, the fruiterer and the village gossip;
"There she sits, a tall, square, upright figure,
surmounted by a pleasant, comely face, eyes
as black as a sloe, cheeks as rounds as an apple,
and a complexion as ruddy as a peach, as fine
a specimen of a healthy, hearty English tradeswoman,
the feminine of John Bull, as one would
desire to see on a summer's day.... As a
gossip she was incomparable. She knew everybody
and everything; had always the freshest
intelligence, and the newest news; her reports
like her plums had the bloom on them, and
she would as much have scorned to palm
upon you an old piece of scandal as to send
you strawberries that had been two days
gathered."</p>

<p>A reviewer in the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> thus criticises
the book:</p>

<p>"If (to be hypercritical) the pictures they
contain be a trifle too sunny and too cheerful to
be real&mdash;if they show more generosity and
refinement and self-sacrifice existing among
the middle classes than does exist,&mdash;too much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
of the meek beauty, too little of the squalidity
of humble life,&mdash;we love them none the less,
and their authoress all the more."</p>

<p>In <i>Belford Regis</i> we miss the fields, the brooks,
the flowers, and the sky, which made the charm
of <i>Our Village</i>. In some respects it is a more
ambitious book, but it has not the perennial
charm of <i>Our Village</i>.</p>

<p>Miss Mitford's favourite author, as we have
seen, was Jane Austen. She had the same
regard for her that Miss Austen felt for Fanny
Burney. The two authors have many points
of resemblance. Both have the same clear
vision, and sunny nature; the same repugnance
to all that is sensational, or coarse, or low; the
same dislike of strong pathos or broad humour;
and Miss Mitford has approached more closely
than any other writer to the elegance of diction
and purity of style of Miss Austen.</p>

<p>They have another point in common, they
both show excellent taste in their writings.
This quality of good taste is due to native delicacy
and refinement, a sensitive withdrawal
from what is ugly, and a quick feeling for true
proportion; the very things which give to a
woman her superior tact, which Ruskin has
called "the touch sense." In the novel it is
pre-eminently a feminine characteristic. Few
men have it in a marked degree. It adds all
the charm we feel in the presence of a refined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
woman to the novels of Miss Edgeworth, Miss
Austen, and Miss Mitford.</p>

<p>But, while Miss Mitford and Miss Austen have
many points of resemblance, they have many
points of difference. Miss Austen liked the
society of men and women, and during her
younger days was fond of dinner-parties and
balls. Miss Mitford preferred the woods and
fields, liked the society of her dogs, and wrote
to a friend before she was twenty that she
would never go to another dance if she could
help it. Miss Austen selects a small group of
gentry, and by the intertwining of their lives
forms a beautiful plot; Miss Mitford rambles
through the village and the country walks of
Three Mile Cross, and as she meets the butcher,
the publican, the boys at cricket, she gleans
some story of interest, and brings back to us, as
it were, a basket in which have been thrown in
careless profusion violets and anemones, cowslips
and daisies, and all the other flowers of the
field.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Mrs. Anna Maria Hall, a country-woman of
Miss Edgeworth, wrote of her first novel:
"<i>My Sketches of Irish Character</i>, my first dear
book, was inspired by a desire to describe
my native place, as Miss Mitford had done in
<i>Our Village</i>, and this made me an author."
Most of these sketches were drawn from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
county of Wexford, her native place, whose
inhabitants, she says in the preface, are descendants
of the Anglo-Norman settlers of the
reign of Henry the Second, and speak a language
unknown in other districts of Ireland.</p>

<p>The book is a series of well-told stories of the
poor people, whom we should have imagined
to be pure Celt, if the author had not said they
resembled the English. There is the tender
pathos, the quick humour, the joke which often
answers an argument, the guidance of the heart
rather than the head; but she has dwelt upon
one characteristic but lightly touched upon by
Miss Edgeworth and Lady Morgan, the poetic
feeling of the Celt, the imagery that so often
adorns their common speech. The old Irish
wife says to the bride who speaks disrespectfully
of the fairies: "Hush, Avourneen! Sure they
have the use of the May-dew before it falls, and
the colour of the lilies and the roses before it's
folded in the tender buds; and can steal the
notes out of the birds' throats while they sleep."</p>

<p><i>The Irish Peasantry</i>, and <i>Lights and Shadows
of Irish Life</i>, won Mrs. Hall the ill-will rather
than the love of her countrymen. She had
lived for a long time in England, and upon returning
to her native land was impressed by the
lack of forethought which kept the country
poor. Their early marriages, their indifference
to time, their frequent visits to the public house,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
their hospitality to strangers even when they
themselves were in extreme poverty and debt&mdash;all
made so deep an impression upon her mind
that she attempted to teach the Irish worldly
wisdom. But the lesson was distasteful to the
people and probably useless, as the characteristics
which she would change were the very
essence of the Irish nature, the traits which
made him a Celt, not a Saxon. In these books,
the wooings, weddings, and funerals are portrayed,
and there is a little glimpse of fairy lore.</p>

<p><i>Midsummer Eve, a Fairy Tale of Love</i>, grew
out of the fairy legends of Ireland. It is said
that a child whose father has died before its
birth is placed by nature under the peculiar
guardianship of the fairies; and, if born on
Midsummer Eve, it becomes their rightful
property; they take it to their own homes and
leave in its place one of their changelings. The
heroine of the story is a child of that nature,
over whose birth the fairies of air, earth, and
water preside. But at the will of Nightstar,
Queen of the Fairies of the Air, she is left with
her mother, but adopted and watched over
by the fairies as their own. Their great gift
to her is that of loving and being loved. The
human element is not well blended with the
fairy element. The entire setting should have
been rural, for in the city of London, particularly
in the exhibition of the Royal Academy, where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
part of the story is placed, it is not easy to keep
the tranquil twilight atmosphere, which fairies
love. The book is like a song in which the
bass and soprano are written in different keys.
But when we are back in Ireland, and the fairies
again appear and disappear, it is charming.
The old woodcutter, Randy, who sees and talks
with the fairies, is a delightful creature, and
gives to the story much of its beauty.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hall's novels have but little literary
value, but she has brought to light Irish characteristics
and Irish traditions which were overlooked
by her predecessors, and for that reason
they deserve to live.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII</h3>

<h2>Lady Caroline Lamb. Mrs. Shelley</h2>


<p>It is impossible to comprehend the Byronic
craze which swept cool-headed England
off her feet during the regency. <i>Childe Harold</i>
was the fashion, and many a hero of romance,
even down to the time of <i>Pendennis</i>, aped his
fashions. Disraeli and Bulwer were among
his disciples. Bulwer's early novels, <i>Falkland</i>
and <i>Pelham</i>, were influenced by him; and
<i>Vivian Grey</i> and <i>Venetia</i> might have been the
offspring of Byron's prose brain, so completely
was Disraeli under his influence at the time.</p>

<p>The poorest of the novels of this class, but
the one which gives the most intimate picture
of Byron, is <i>Glenarvon</i>, by Lady Caroline Lamb.
Its hero is Byron. The plot follows the outlines
of her own life, and all the characters were
counterparts of living people whom she knew.
Calantha, the heroine, representing Lady Caroline,
is married to Lord Avondale, or William
Lamb, better known as Lord Melbourne, at
one time Premier of England. Lord and Lady
Avondale are very happy, until Glenarvon,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
"the spirit of evil," appears and dazzles Calantha.
Twice she is about to elope with him,
but the thought of her husband and children
keeps her back. They part, and for a time
tender <i>billets-doux</i> pass between them, until
Calantha receives a cruel letter from Glenarvon,
in which he bids her leave him in peace. Other
well-known people appeared in the book. Lord
Holland was the Great Nabob, Lady Holland
was the Princess of Madagascar, and Samuel
Rogers was the Yellow Hyena or the Pale Poet.
The novel had also a moral purpose; it was
intended to show the danger of a life devoted
to pleasure and fashion.</p>

<p>Of course the book made a sensation. Lady
Caroline Lamb, the daughter of Earl Bessborough,
the granddaughter of Earl Spencer, related
to nearly all the great houses of England,
had all her life followed every impulse of a too
susceptible imagination. Her infatuation for
Lord Byron had long been a theme for gossip
throughout London. She invited him constantly
to her home; went to assemblies in his
carriage; and, if he were invited to parties to
which she was not, walked the streets to meet
him; she confided to every chance acquaintance
that she was dying of love for him. Yet,
as one reads of this affair, one suspects that this
devotion was nothing more than the infatuation
of a high-strung nature for the hero of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
romance. In writing to a friend about her
husband, she says, "He was privy to my affair
with Lord Byron and laughed at it." On her
death-bed she said of her husband, "But remember,
the only noble fellow I ever met with
was William Lamb."</p>

<p>A month after her death, Lord Melbourne
wrote a sketch of her life for the <i>Literary Gazette</i>.
In this he said:</p>

<p>"Her character it is difficult to analyse,
because, owing to the extreme susceptibility
of her imagination, and the unhesitating and
rapid manner in which she followed its impulses,
her conduct was one perpetual kaleidoscope of
changes.... To the poor she was invariably
charitable&mdash;she was more: in spite of her ordinary
thoughtlessness of self, for them she had
consideration as well as generosity, and delicacy
no less than relief. For her friends she had a
ready and active love; for her enemies no hatred:
never perhaps was there a human being who had
less malevolence; as all her errors hurt only
herself, so against herself only were levelled her
accusation and reproach."</p>

<p>How far Byron was in earnest in this tragicomedy
is more difficult to determine. In one
letter to her he writes: "I was and am yours,
freely and entirely, to obey, to honour, to love,
and fly with you, where, when, and how yourself
might and may determine." That Byron<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
was piqued when he read the book, his letter to
Moore proves: "By the way, I suppose you
have seen <i>Glenarvon</i>. It seems to me if the
authoress had written the truth&mdash;the whole
truth&mdash;the romance would not only have
been more romantic, but more entertaining.
As for the likeness, the picture can't be good;
I did not sit long enough." It was not pleasing
to Lord Byron's vanity to appear in her book
as the spirit of evil, beside her husband, a
high-minded gentleman, ready to sacrifice for
his friends everything "but his honour and
integrity."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the humorous elements in
the connection of Lord Byron and Lady Caroline
Lamb, the story is pathetic. His poetic personality
attracted her as the light does the poor
moth. Disraeli caricatured her in the character
of Mrs. Felix Lorraine in <i>Vivian Grey</i>,
and introduced her into <i>Venetia</i> under the title
of Lady Monteagle, where he made much of
her love for the poet Cadurcis, otherwise Lord
Byron.</p>

<p>Lady Caroline Lamb wrote two other novels,
but they are of no value. In her third, <i>Ada
Reis</i>, considered her best, she introduced Bulwer
as the good spirit.</p>

<p>The little poem written by Lady Caroline
Lamb on the day fixed for her departure from
Brocket Hall, after it had been decided that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
she was to live in retirement away from her
husband and son, shows tenderness and poetic
feeling:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
They dance&mdash;they sing&mdash;they bless the day,<br />
I weep the while&mdash;and well I may:<br />
Husband, nor child, to greet me come,<br />
Without a friend&mdash;without a home:<br />
I sit beneath my favourite tree,<br />
Sing then, my little birds, to me,<br />
In music, love, and liberty.<br />
</p></div>

<p>At the time that the British public was smiling
graciously, even if a little humorously, upon
Lady Caroline Lamb, and was lionising Lord
Byron, it spurned from its presence with the
greatest disdain Percy and Mary Shelley. Even
after the death of Shelley, when Mary returned
to London with herself and son to support, it
received her as the prodigal daughter for whom
the crumbs from the rich man's table must
suffice.</p>

<p>Mary Shelley had inherited from her mother
the world's frown. Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin
had been, the greater part of her life, at
variance with society. She was the author, as
has been said, of the <i>Vindication of the Rights
of Woman</i>, and had for a long time been an
opponent of marriage, chiefly because the civil
laws pertaining to it deprived both husband
and wife of their proper liberty. Her bitter
experience with Imlay had, however, so modi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>fied
her views on this latter subject that she
became the wife of William Godwin a short
time before the birth of their daughter Mary,
who in after years became Mrs. Shelley. Although
her mother died at her birth, Mary
Godwin was deeply imbued with her theories
of life. She had read her books, and had often
heard her father express the same views concerning
the bondage of marriage and its uselessness.
Her elopement with Shelley while
his wife Harriet was still living gains a certain
sanction from the fact that she plighted her
troth to him at her mother's grave. After the
sad death of Harriet, however, Shelley and
Mary Godwin conceded to the world's opinion,
and were legally married. But the anger of
society was not appeased, and, even after both
had become famous, it continued to ignore the
poet Shelley and his gifted wife.</p>

<p>At the age of nineteen Mrs. Shelley was led
to write her first novel. Mr. and Mrs. Shelley
and Byron were spending the summer of 1816
in the mountains of Switzerland. Continuous
rain kept them in-doors, where they passed
the time in reading ghost stories. At the suggestion
of Byron, each one agreed to write a
blood-curdling tale. It is one of the strange
freaks of invention that this young girl succeeded
where Shelley and Byron failed. Byron
wrote a fragment of a story which was printed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
with <i>Mazeppa</i>. Shelley also began a story,
but when he had reduced his characters to a
most pitiable condition, he wearied of them and
could devise no way to bring the tale to a fitting
conclusion. After listening to a conversation
between the two poets upon the possibilities of
science discovering the secrets of life, the story
known as <i>Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus</i>
shaped itself in Mary's mind.</p>

<p><i>Frankenstein</i> is one of those novels that
defy the critic. Everyone recognises that the
letters written by Captain Walton to his sister
in which he tells of his meeting with Frankenstein,
and repeats to her the story he has just
heard from his guest, makes an awkward introduction
to the real narrative. Yet all this part
about Captain Walton and his crew was added
at the suggestion of Shelley after the rest of the
story had been written. But the narrative of
Frankenstein is so powerful, so real, that, once
read, it can never be forgotten. Mrs. Shelley
wrote in the introduction of the edition of 1839
that, before writing it, she was trying to think
of a story, "one that would speak to the mysterious
fears of our nature, and awaken thrilling
horror&mdash;one to make the reader dread to look
round, to curdle the blood and quicken the
beatings of the heart." That she has done
this the experience of every reader will prove.</p>

<p>But the story has a greater hold on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
imagination than this alone would give it. The
monster created by Frankenstein is closely related
to our own human nature. "My heart
was fashioned to be susceptible of love and
sympathy," he says, "and, when wrenched by
misery to vice and hatred, it did not endure the
violence of the change without torture, such
as you cannot even imagine." There is a wonderful
blending of good and evil in this demon,
and, while the magnitude of his crimes makes us
shudder, his wrongs and his loneliness awaken
our pity. "The fallen angel becomes a malignant
devil. Yet even that enemy of God and
man had friends and associates in his desolation;
I am quite alone," the monster complains to his
creator. Who can forget the scene where he
watches Frankenstein at work making for him
the companion that he had promised? Perhaps
sadder than the story of the monster is that of
Frankenstein, who, led by a desire to widen
human knowledge, finds that the fulfilment of
his lofty ambition has brought only a curse to
mankind.</p>

<p>In 1823, Mary Shelley published a second
novel, <i>Valperga</i>, so named from a castle and
small independent territory near Lucca. Castruccio
Castracani, whose life Machiavelli has
told, is the hero of the story. The greatest
soldier and satirist of his times, the man of the
novel is considered inferior to the man of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
history. Mrs. Shelley had read broadly before
beginning the book, and she has described
minutely the customs of the age about which
she is writing. Shelley pronounced it "a
living and moving picture of an age almost
forgotten."</p>

<p>The interest centres in the two heroines,
Euthanasia, Countess of Valperga, and Beatrice,
Prophetess of Ferrara. Strong, intellectual,
and passionate, not until the time of George
Eliot did women of this type become prominent
in fiction. Euthanasia, a Guelph and a Florentine,
with a soul "adapted for the reception of
all good," was betrothed to the youth Castruccio,
whom she at that time loved. Later,
when his character deteriorated under the influence
of selfish ambition, she ceased to love
him, and said, "He cast off humanity, honesty,
honourable feeling, all that I prize." Castruccio
belonged to the Ghibelines, so that the story
of their love is intertwined with the struggle
between these two parties in Italy.</p>

<p>But more beautiful than the intellectual
character of Euthanasia, is the spiritual one of
Beatrice, the adopted daughter of the bishop of
Ferrara, who is regarded with feelings of reverence
by her countrymen, because of her prophetic
powers. Pure and deeply religious, she accepted
all the suggestions of her mind as a message from
God. When Castruccio came to Ferrara and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
was entertained by the bishop as the prince
and liberator of his country, she believed that
together they could accomplish much for her
beloved country: "She prayed to the Virgin to
inspire her; and, again giving herself up to
reverie, she wove a subtle web, whose materials
she believed heavenly, but which were indeed
stolen from the glowing wings of love." No
wonder she believed the dictates of her own
heart, she whose words the superstition of the
age had so often declared miraculous. She
was barely seventeen and she loved for the first
time. How pathetic is her disillusionment when
Castruccio bade her farewell for a season, as
he was about to leave Ferrara. She had believed
that the Holy Spirit had brought Castruccio
to her that by the union of his manly
qualities and her divine attributes some great
work might be fulfilled. But as he left her,
he spoke only of earthly happiness:</p>

<p>"It was her heart, her whole soul she had
given; her understanding, her prophetic powers,
all the little universe that with her ardent spirit
she grasped and possessed, she had surrendered,
fully, and without reserve; but, alas! the most
worthless part alone had been accepted, and the
rest cast as dust upon the winds."</p>

<p>Afterwards, when she wandered forth a
beggar, and was rescued by Euthanasia, she
exclaimed to her:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>"You either worship a useless shadow, or a
fiend in the clothing of a God."</p>

<p>The daughter of Mary Wollstonecraft could
fully sympathise with Beatrice. In the grief,
almost madness, with which Beatrice realises
her self-deception, there are traces of Frankenstein.
Perhaps no problem plucked from the
tree of good and evil was so ever-present to
Mary Shelley as why misery so often follows
an obedience to the highest dictates of the soul.
Both her father and mother had experienced
this; and she and Shelley had tasted of the same
bitter fruit. In the analysis of Beatrice's emotions
Mrs. Shelley shows herself akin to Charlotte
Bront&euml;.</p>

<p>Three years after the death of Shelley, she
published <i>The Last Man</i>. It relates to England
in the year 2073 when, the king having abdicated
his throne, England had become a republic.
Soon after this, however a pestilence fell upon
the people, which drove them upon the continent,
where they travelled southward, until
only one man remained. The plot is clumsy;
the characters are abstractions.</p>

<p>But the feelings of the author, written in
clear letters on every page, are a valuable
addition to the history of the poet Shelley and
his wife. Besides her fresh sorrow for her husband,
Byron had died only the year before. Her
mind was brooding on the days the three had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
spent together. Her grief was too recent to be
shaken from her mind or lost sight of in her imaginative
work. Shelley, and the scenes she had
looked on with him, the conversations between
him and his friends, creep in on every page.
Lionel Verney, the Last Man, is the supposed
narrator of the story. He thus describes Adrian,
the son of the king: "A tall, slim, fair boy, with
a physiognomy expressive of the excess of sensibility
and refinement, stood before me; the
morning sunbeams tinged with gold his silken
hair, and spread light and glory over his beaming
countenance ... he seemed like an inspired
musician, who struck, with unerring skill, the
'lyre of mind,' and produced thence divinest harmony....
His slight frame was over informed
by the soul that dwelt within.... He was gay as
a lark carrolling from its skiey tower.... The
young and inexperienced did not understand
the lofty severity of his moral views, and disliked
him as a being different from themselves."
Shelley, of course, was the original of this picture.
Lord Byron suggested the character of
Lord Raymond: "The earth was spread out as
a highway for him; the heavens built up as a
canopy for him." "Every trait spoke predominate
self-will; his smile was pleasing, though
disdain too often curled his lips&mdash;lips which to
female eyes were the very throne of beauty and
love.... Thus full of contradictions, unbending<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
yet haughty, gentle yet fierce, tender and again
neglectful, he by some strange art found easy
entrance to the admiration and affection of
women; now caressing and now tyrannising
over them according to his mood, but in every
change a despot."</p>

<p>A large part of the three volumes is taken
up with a characterisation of Adrian and Lord
Raymond, the latter of whom falls when fighting
for the Greeks. How impossible it was for
her to rid her mind of her own sorrow is shown
at the end of the third volume, where Adrian
is drowned, and Lionel Verney is left alone.
He thus says of his friend:</p>

<p>"All I had possessed of this world's goods,
of happiness, knowledge, or virtue&mdash;I owed to
him. He had, in his person, his intellect, and
rare qualities, given a glory to my life, which
without him it had never known. Beyond all
other beings he had taught me that goodness,
pure and simple, can be an attribute of man."</p>

<p>Mrs. Shelley made the great mistake of writing
this novel in the first person. <i>The Last
Man</i>, who is telling the story, although he has
the name of Lionel, is most assuredly of the
female sex. The friendship between him and
Adrian is not the friendship of man for man,
but rather the love of man and woman.</p>

<p>Mrs. Shelley's next novel, <i>Lodore</i>, written in
1835, thirteen years after the death of her hus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>band,
had a better outlined plot and more definite
characters. But again it echoes the past.
Lord Byron's unhappy married relations and
Shelley's troubles with Harriet are blended in
the story, Lord Byron furnishing the character
in some respects of Lord Lodore, while his wife,
Cornelia Santerre, resembles both Harriet and
Lady Byron. Lady Santerre, the mother of
Cornelia, augments the trouble between Lord
and Lady Lodore, and, contrary to the evident
intentions of the writer, the reader's sympathies
are largely with Cornelia and Lady Santerre.
When Lodore wishes Cornelia to go to America
to save him from disgrace, Lady Santerre
objects to her daughter's accompanying him:</p>

<p>"He will soon grow tired of playing the tragic
hero on a stage surrounded by no spectators;
he will discover the folly of his conduct; he will
return, and plead for forgiveness, and feel that
he is too fortunate in a wife who has preserved
her own conduct free from censure and remark
while he has made himself a laughing-stock to
all."</p>

<p>These words strangely bring to mind Lord
Byron as having evoked them.</p>

<p>Again Lady Lodore's letter to her husband
at the time of his departure to America reminds
one of Lady Byron:</p>

<p>"If heaven have blessings for the coldly
egotistical, the unfeeling despot, may those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
blessings be yours; but do not dare to interfere
with emotions too pure, too disinterested for
you ever to understand. Give me my child,
and fear neither my interference nor resentment."</p>

<p>Lady Lodore's character changes in the book,
and becomes more like that of Harriet Shelley.
As Mrs. Shelley wrote, fragments of the past
evidently came into her mind and influenced
her pen, and her original conception of the
characters was forgotten. Clorinda, the beautiful,
eloquent, and passionate Neapolitan, was
drawn from Emilia Viviani, who had suggested
to Shelley his poem <i>Epipsychidion</i>, while both
Horatio Saville, who had "no thought but for
the nobler creations of the soul, and the discernment
of the sublime laws of God and
nature," and his cousin Villiers, also an enthusiastic
worshipper of nature, possessed many of
Shelley's qualities.</p>

<p>Besides two other novels of no value, <i>Perkin
Warbeck</i> and <i>Falkner</i>, Mrs. Shelley wrote numerous
short stories for the annuals, at that time
so much in vogue. In 1891, these were collected
and edited with an appreciative criticism
by Sir Richard Garnett. Many of them
have the intensity and sustained interest of
Frankenstein.</p>

<p>After the death of her husband, grief and
trouble dimmed Mrs. Shelley's imagination.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
But the pale student Frankenstein, the monster
he created, and the beautiful priestess,
Beatrice, three strong conceptions, testify to
the genius of Mary Shelley.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII</h3>

<h2>Mrs. Gore. Mrs. Bray</h2>


<p>During the second decade of the nineteenth
century, while Scott was writing
some of the most powerful of the Waverley
novels, a host of new writers sprang into popular
notice. John Galt, William Harrison Ainsworth,
and G. P. R. James began their endless
series of historical romances, while in 1827,
Bulwer Lytton and Benjamin Disraeli introduced
to the reading public, as the representatives
of fashionable society, <i>Falkland</i> and
<i>Vivian Grey</i>. The decade was prolific also in
novels by women. Jane Austen had died in 1817,
but Maria Edgeworth, Lady Morgan, the Porters,
Amelia Opie, Miss Ferrier, Mrs. Shelley and
Miss Mitford were still writing; during this
period, Mrs. S. C. Hall began her work in imitation
of Miss Mitford, while Mrs. Gore and
Mrs. Bray took up the goose-quill, piled reams
of paper on their desks, and began their literary
careers.</p>

<p>About a score of years before Thackeray
tickled English society with pictures of its own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
snobbery, Mrs. Gore, a young woman, wife of
an officer in the Life Guards, saw through the
many affectations of the polite world, and in a
series of novels, pointed out its ludicrous pretences
with lively wit. Mrs. Gore has suffered,
however, from the multiplicity of her writings.
During the years between 1823, when she wrote
her first novel, <i>Theresa Marchmont</i>, and 1850,
when, quite blind, she retired from the world of
letters, she published two hundred volumes of
novels, plays, and poems. Her plots are often
hastily constructed, her men and women dimly
outlined, but she is never dull. No writer
since Congreve has so many sparkling lines.
She has been likened to Horace, and if we compare
her wit with that of Thackeray, who by the
way ridiculed her in his <i>Novels by Eminent
Hands</i>, her humour has qualities of old Falernian,
beside which his too frequently has the
bitter flavour of old English beer. The Englishman
is inclined to take his wit, like his sports,
too seriously, and to mingle with it a little of
the spice of envy. Mrs. Gore has none of this,
however, and skims along the surface of fashionable
life with a grace and ease and humour
extremely diverting.</p>

<p>Her writings are so voluminous that one can
only make excerpts at random. One of the
liveliest is <i>Cecil, or the Adventures of a Coxcomb</i>,
a humorous satire on <i>Vivian Grey</i>. "The arch-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>coxcomb
of his coxcombical time" had become
a coxcomb at the age of six months, when he
first saw himself in the mirror, from which time
his nurse stopped his crying by tossing him in
front of a looking-glass. His curls made him
so attractive that at six years of age he was
admitted to his mother's boudoir, from which
his red-headed brother was excluded, and he
superseded the spaniel in her ladyship's carriage.
With the loss of his curls went the loss of favour.
He did not prosper at school, and was rusticated
after a year's residence at Oxford. Here he
formed an acquaintance which helped him much
in the world of coxcombry. Though this man
was not well born, he was an admitted leader
among gentlemen. Cecil soon discovered that
his high social position was due entirely to his
impertinence, and he made this wise observation:
"Impudence is the quality of a footman;
impertinence of his master. Impudence is a
thing to be rebutted with brute force; impertinence
requires wit for the putting down." So
he matched his wit with this man's impertinence,
and they became sworn friends.</p>

<p>When Cecil went to London, he found that
"people had supped full of horrors, during the
Revolution, and were now devoted to elegiac
measures. My languid smile and hazel eyes
were the very thing to settle the business of the
devoted beings left for execution." Of course<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
all the women fell desperately in love with him.
"I had always a predisposition to woman-slaughter,
with extenuating circumstances, as
well as a stirring consciousness of the exterminating
power," he explains to us. Like Childe
Harold and Vivian Grey, this coxcomb soon
became weary of London, and travelled through
Europe in an indolent way, for after all it was
his chief pleasure "to lie in an airy French
bed, showered over with blue convolvulus,"
and read tender billets from the ladies. This
book was an excellent antidote to the Byronic
fever, then at its height.</p>

<p>In her <i>Sketches of English Character</i>, Mrs.
Gore describes different men who were in her
time to be met with in the social life of London.
The Dining-Out Man thus speaks for himself:</p>

<p>"Ill-natured people fancy that the life of a
dining-out man is a life of corn, wine, and oil;
that all he has to do is to eat, drink and be
merry. I only know that, had I been aware in
the onset of life, of all I should have to go
through in my vocation, I would have chosen
some easier calling. I would have studied law,
physic, or divinity."</p>

<p>In the sketches of <i>The Clubman</i>, she assigns
John Bull's dislike of ladies' society as
the reason for the many clubs in the English
metropolis:</p>

<p>"While admitting woman to be a divinity,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
he chooses to conceal his idol in the Holy of
Holies of domestic life. Duly to enjoy the
society of Mrs. Bull, he chooses a smoking
tureen, and cod's head and shoulders to intervene
between them, and their olive branches
to be around their table.... For John adores
woman in the singular, and hates her in the
plural; John loves, but does not like. Woman
is the object of his passion, rarely of his regard.
There is nothing in the gaiety of heart or sprightliness
of intellect of the weaker sex which he
considers an addition to society. To him
women are an interruption to business and
pleasure."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gore could also unveil hypocrisy. In
her novel <i>Preferment, or My Uncle the Earl</i>, she
thus describes a worthy ornament of the church:</p>

<p>"The Dean of Darbington glided along his
golden railroad&mdash;'mild as moonbeams'&mdash;soft as
a swansdown muff&mdash;insinuating as a silken
eared spaniel. His conciliating arguments
were whispered in a tone suitable to the sick
chamber of a nervous hypochondriac, and his
strain of argument resembled its potations of
thin, weak, well-sweetened barley water. While
Dr. Macnab succeeded with <i>his</i> congregation
by kicking and bullying them along the path
of grace, Dr. Nicewig held out his finger with
a coaxing air and gentle chirrup, like a bird-fancier
decoying a canary."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>A critic in the <i>Westminster Review</i> in 1831
thus writes of her:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Gore has a perfectly feminine knowledge
of all the weaknesses and absurdities
of an ordinary man of fashion, following the
routine of London life in the season. She
unmasks his selfishness with admirable acuteness;
she exposes his unromantic egotism, with
delightful sauciness. Her portraits of women
are also executed with great spirit; but not
with the same truth. In transferring men to
her canvas, she has relied upon the faculty of
observation, usually fine and vigilant in a
woman; but when portraying her own sex, the
authoress has perhaps looked within; and the
study of the internal operations of the human
machine is a far more complex affair, and requires
far more extensive experience, and also
different faculties, from those necessary to acquire
a perfect knowledge of the appearances on
the surface of humanity."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding Mrs. Gore touches so lightly
on the surface of life, certain definite sociological
and moral principles underlie her work.
She is as democratic as Charlotte Smith, Mrs.
Inchbald, Miss Mitford, or even William Godwin.
She asserts again and again that men of inferior
birth with the same opportunities of education
may be as intellectual and refined as the sons
of a "hundred earls." Those members of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
aristocracy who fail to recognise the true worth
of intelligent men of plebeian origin are made
very ridiculous. In her novel <i>Pin Money</i>, published
in 1831, how very funny is Lady Derenzy's
speech when she learns that a soap manufacturer
is being f&ecirc;ted in fashionable society!
Lady Derenzy, by the way, is the social law-giver
to her little coterie:</p>

<p>"It is now some years," said she, "since the
independence of America, and the influence
exerted in this country by the return of a large
body of enlightened men, habituated to the
demoralising spectacle of an equalisation of
rank, was supposed to exert a pernicious influence
on the minds of the secondary and inferior
classes of Great Britain. At that critical
moment I whispered to my husband, 'Derenzy!
be true to yourself, and the world will be true
to you. Let the aristocracy of Great Britain
unite in support of the Order; and it will maintain
its ground against the universe!' Lord
Derenzy took my advice, and the country was
saved.</p>

<p>"Again, when the assemblage of the States
General of France,&mdash;the fatal tocsin of the
revolution,&mdash;spread consternation and horror
throughout the higher ranks of every European
country, and the very name of the guillotine
operated like a spell on the British peerage, I
whispered to my husband, 'Derenzy! be true<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
to yourself, and the world will be true to you.
Let the aristocracy of Great Britain unite in
support of the Order; and it will maintain its
ground against the universe!' Again Lord
Derenzy took my advice, and again the country
was saved."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gore has so cleverly mingled the so-called
self-made men and men of inherited rank in
her books that one cannot distinguish between
them. In <i>The Soldier of Lyons</i>, one of her early
novels, which furnished Bulwer with the plot
of his play <i>The Lady of Lyons</i>, the hero, a
peasant by birth and a soldier of the Republic,
enters into a marriage contract with the widow
of a French marquis, in order to save her from
the guillotine. This lady of high rank learns
to respect her husband, and becomes the suitor
for his love. In <i>The Heir of Selwood</i>, a former
field marshal of Napoleon, a peasant, devotes
his energies to improving the condition of the
poor on the estate he had won by his services
to his country, and at his death his tenants
erected a column to his memory, bearing the
inscription: "Most dear to God, to the king, and
to the people."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gore constantly asserts that the only
distinctions between men are based upon character
and ability. She says of one of her characters,
a poet:</p>

<p>"His footing in society is no longer dependent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
upon the caprice of a drawing-room. It is the
security of that intellectual power which forces
the world to bend the knee. The poor, dreamy
boy, self-taught, self-aided, had risen into power.
He wields a pen. And the pen in our age weighs
heavier in the social scale than a sword of a
Norman baron."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gore lived at a time when the introduction
of machinery and the establishment
of large factories was producing a new type
of man: men like Burtonshaw in <i>The Hamiltons</i>:
"A practical, matter-of-fact individual, with
plenty of money and plenty of intellect; the sort
of human power-loom one would back to work
wonders against a dawdling old spinning-jenny
like Lord Tottenham."</p>

<p>A critic in the <i>Westminster Review</i> wrote in
1832 as follows:</p>

<p>"The wealthy merchant or money-dealer is
represented, perhaps for the first time in fiction,
as a man of true dignity, self-respect, education,
and thorough integrity, agreeable in manners,
refined in tastes, and content with, if not proud
of, his position in society."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gore was called by her contemporaries
the novelist of the new era.</p>

<p>She was also interested in the great ethical
questions of life. She did not write of the
love of youthful heroes and more youthful
heroines. She often traced the consequences<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
of sin on character and destiny. In <i>The Heir
of Selwood</i>, she is as stern a moralist in tracing
the effects of vice as George Eliot. <i>The Banker's
Wife</i>, the scene of which is laid among the merchants
of London, is a serious study of the sorrows
of a life devoted to outward show. The
picture of the banker among his guests, whose
wealth, unknown to them, he has squandered,
reminds one of the days before the final overthrow
of Dombey and Son.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gore was a woman of genius. With the
stern principles of the puritan, and feelings as
republican as the mountain-born Swiss, she was
never controversial. She saw the absurdities
of certain hollow pretensions of society, but her
good-humoured raillery offended no one. If her
two hundred volumes could be weeded of
their verbiage by some devotee of literature,
and reduced to ten or fifteen, they would be not
only entertaining reading, but would throw
strong lights upon the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of London in the days
when hair-oils, pomades, and strong perfumes
were the distinguishing marks of the Quality.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Mrs. Gore owed her place in English letters
to native wit and ability; Mrs. Bray owed hers
to hard study and painstaking endeavour. She
was one of the few women who followed the
style of writing brought to perfection by Sir
Walter Scott.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Bray became imbued with the historic
spirit early in life. Her first husband was
Charles Stothard, the author of <i>Monumental
Effigies of Great Britain</i>, with whom she travelled
through Brittany, Normandy and Flanders.
While he made careful drawings of the ruins
of castles and abbeys, she read Froissart's
<i>Chronicles</i>, visited the places which he has
described, and traced out among the people any
surviving customs which he has recorded.</p>

<p>Two novels were the result of these studies.
<i>De Foix, or Sketches of the Manners and Customs
of the Fourteenth Century</i>, is a story of Gaston
Phoebus, Count de Foix, whose court Froissart
visited, and of whom he wrote: "To speak
briefly and truly, the Count de Foix was perfect
in person and in mind; and no contemporary
prince could be compared with him for sense,
honour, or liberality." <i>The White Hoods</i>, a name
by which the citizens of Ghent were denominated,
is laid in the Netherlands, and tells of
the conflict between the court and the citizens
of Ghent, under Philip von Artaveld, during
the reign of Charles the Fifth of France and the
early kingship of Charles the Sixth. As in all
her novels, the accuracy for which she strove
in the most minute details retards the action
of the plot, but adds to the historical value of
these romances.</p>

<p>For the tragic romance of <i>The Talba, or Moor of Portugal</i>,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
Mrs. Bray, as she had not visited
the Spanish peninsula, depended upon her reading.
The plot was suggested to her by a picture
of Ines de Castro in the Royal Academy. It
represented the gruesome coronation of the
corpse of Ines de Castro, six years after her
death. Thus did her husband, Don Pedro,
show honour to his wife, who had been put to
death while he, then a prince, was serving in the
army of Portugal. The whole story is a fitting
theme for tragedy, and was at one time dramatised
by Mary Mitford. In order to give her
mind the proper elevation for the impassioned
scenes of this novel, it was Mrs. Bray's custom
to read a chapter of Isaiah or Job each day
before beginning to write.</p>

<p>After the death of her first husband, Mrs.
Bray married the vicar of Tavistock, and for
thirty-five years lived in the vicarage of that
town. Here she became interested in the
legends of Devon and Cornwall, and wrote five
novels founded upon the history of tradition
of those counties. <i>Henry de Pomeroy</i> opens
at the abbey of Tavistock, one of the oldest
abbeys in England, during the reign of Richard
C&#339;ur-de-Leon. The scene of <i>Fitz of Fitz-Ford</i> is
also laid at Tavistock, but during the reign of
Queen Elizabeth. Another story of the reign of
the Virgin Queen was <i>Warleigh, or the Fatal Oak:
a Legend of Devon</i>. <i>Courtenay of Walreddon: a</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
<i>Romance of the West</i> takes place in the reign of
Charles the First, about the commencement
of the Civil War. A gypsy girl, by name Cinderella
Small, is introduced into the story, and
has been highly praised. The character, as well
as some of the stories told of her, was drawn
from life.</p>

<p>But the most famous of these novels is <i>Trelawny
of Trelawne; or the Prophecy: a Legend
of Cornwall</i>, a story of the rebellion of Monmouth.
Like most of the romances upon English
themes, the private history of the family
furnishes the romance, the historical happenings
being used only for the setting: the usual method
of Scott. The hero of this novel is Sir Jonathan
Trelawny, one of the seven bishops who were
committed to the Tower by James the Second.
When he was arrested by the king's command,
the Cornish men rose one and all, and marched
as far as Exeter, in their way to extort his
liberation. Trelawny is a popular hero of Cornwall,
as the following lines testify:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
A good sword and a trusty hand!<br />
A merry heart and true!<br />
King James's men shall understand<br />
What Cornish lads can do!<br />
<br />
And have they fixed the where and when?<br />
And shall Trelawny die?<br />
Here's twenty thousand Cornish men<br />
Will know the reason why!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span><br />
Out spake their captain brave and bold,<br />
A merry wight was he&mdash;<br />
"If London Tower were Michael's hold,<br />
We'll set Trelawny free!"<br />
<br />
We'll cross the Tamar, land to land,<br />
The Severn is no stay,<br />
All side to side, and hand to hand,<br />
And who shall say us nay?<br />
<br />
And when we come to London Wall,<br />
A pleasant sight to view,<br />
Come forth! Come forth! Ye cowards all,<br />
To better men than you!<br />
<br />
Trelawny he's in keep and hold&mdash;<br />
Trelawny he may die,<br />
But here's twenty thousand Cornish bold<br />
Will know the reason why!<br />
</p></div>

<p>Like Scott, Mrs. Bray went about with notebook
in hand, and noted the features of the
landscape, the details of a ruin, or the furniture
or armour of the period of which she was writing.
It is this painstaking work, together with the
fact that she had access to places and books
that were then denied to the ordinary reader,
and chose subjects and places not before treated
in fiction, that gives permanent value to her
writings. She also had the proper feeling for
the past, and dignity and elevation of style.
Sometimes an entire page of her romances<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
might be attributed to the pen of the "Mighty
Wizard." Perhaps the highest compliment
that can be paid her as an artist is that she
resembles Scott when he is nodding.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV</h3>

<h2>Julia Pardoe. Mrs. Trollope.
Harriet Martineau</h2>


<p>Somewhere between the second and third
decades of the nineteenth century, the
modern novel was born. The romances of
the twenties are, for the most part, old-fashioned
in tone, and speak of an earlier age; but in the
thirties, the modern novel, with its exact reproduction
of places, customs, and speech, and
strong local flavour, was full-grown. Dickens,
under the name of Boz, was contributing his
sketches to <i>The Old Monthly Magazine</i> and the
<i>Evening Chronicle</i>. Thackeray was beginning
to contribute articles to <i>Fraser's Magazine</i>,
established in 1830. Annuals and monthlies
sprang up in the night, and paid large sums
for long and short stories. The thirst for them
was unquenchable. Many women were supporting
themselves by writing tales which did
not live beyond the year of their publication.
Mrs. Marsh was writing stories of fashionable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
life varied by historical romances. Mrs. Crowe
wrote stories of fashionable life varied by supernatural
romances and tales of adventure. In
<i>The Story of Lilly Dawson</i>, published in 1847,
the heroine was captured and brought up by
smugglers, and the gradual development of her
character was traced; thus giving to the story a
psychological interest. Lady Blessington earned
two thousand pounds a year for twenty years by
novels and short stories of fashionable life.
Lady Blessington had a European reputation
as a court beauty and a brilliant and witty
conversationalist. This with the coronet must
have helped to sell her books. They do not
contain even a sentence that holds the attention.
A friend said of her, "Her genius lay in her
tongue; her pen paralysed it." More enduring
work in fiction was done by Julia Pardoe, Mrs.
Trollope, and Harriet Martineau.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The novels of Julia Pardoe, like those of Mrs.
Bray, owe their value, not to their intrinsic
merit, but to the comparatively unknown places
to which she introduces her readers. She accompanied
her father, Major Pardoe, to Constantinople,
where they were entertained by
natives of high position, to whom they had
letters of introduction, and Miss Pardoe was
the guest of their wives in the harem. Her
knowledge of the mode of life and habits of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
thought of Turkish women is considered second
only to that of Mary Wortley Montagu.</p>

<p>The material for her story <i>The Romance of
the Harem</i> was obtained during her visits to
these Turkish ladies. In this she has caught
the languid, heavily perfumed atmosphere of
the Orient. Besides the main plot, stories of
adventure and love are related which beguiled
the slowly passing hours of the inmates of the
seraglio. Some of them might have been told
by Schehezerhade, if she had wished to add to
her entertainment of <i>The Thousand and One
Nights</i>.</p>

<p>After Miss Pardoe's return to England, she
wrote a series of fashionable novels, inferior
to many of those of Mrs. Gore, and better than
the best of those by Lady Blessington. <i>Confessions
of a Pretty Woman</i>, <i>The Jealous Wife</i>,
and <i>The Rival Beauties</i> were the most popular
of these, although they have long since been
forgotten.</p>

<p>In 1849, Miss Pardoe published a collection
of stories under the title <i>Flies in Amber</i>. The
title, she explains in the preface, was suggested
by a belief of the Orientals that amber comes
from the sea, and attracts about it all insects,
which find in it both a prison and a posthumous
existence. Some of the stories of this collection
were gathered in her travels. <i>An
Adventure in Bithynia</i>, <i>The Magyar and the</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
<i>Moslem, or an Hungarian Legend</i>, and the <i>Y&egrave;r&egrave;-Batan-Sera&iuml;</i>,
which means Swallowed-up Palace,
the great subterranean ruin of Constantinople,
have the interest which always attaches to tales
gathered by travellers in unfrequented places.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Mrs. Frances Trollope, the mother of the more
famous author Anthony Trollope, like Miss
Pardoe, found material for stories in unfamiliar
places. Mrs. Trollope had the nature of the
pioneer. With her family, she sought our
western lands of the Mississippi Valley, where
the virgin forest had resounded to the axe of
the first settler but a short time before. She
wrote the first book of any note describing the
manners of the Americans; the first strong
novel calling attention to the evils of slavery
in our Southern States; and the first one describing
graphically the white slavery in the
cotton-mills of Lancashire; and she is, perhaps,
the only writer who began a long literary career
at the age of fifty-two.</p>

<p>On the fourth of November, 1827, Mrs. Trollope
with her three children sailed from London,
and, after about seven weeks on the sea, arrived
on Christmas Day at the mouth of the Mississippi.
After a brief visit in New Orleans, this
party of English travellers sailed up the river
to Memphis, where, remote from the comforts
of civilisation, they abode for a time under the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
direction of Mrs. Wright, an English lecturer
who had come to America for the avowed
purpose of proving the perfect equality of the
black and white races. But Mrs. Trollope and
her family soon tired of life in the wilderness,
and sought Cincinnati, at that time a small city
of wooden houses, not over thirty years of age.
After two years' residence in Cincinnati, she
went by stage to Baltimore, visited Philadelphia
and New York, and returned to England, after
a sojourn of three and a half years in this
country.</p>

<p>During her residence in the United States,
she made copious notes of what she saw and
heard. These she published the year after her
return to England, under the title <i>Domestic
Manners of the Americans</i>. At once the pens
of all the critics were let loose upon the author.
Her American critics declared that she knew
nothing about them or their country; and their
English friends refused to believe that the people
of America had such shocking bad manners.</p>

<p>Mrs. Trollope reported truthfully what she saw
and heard. But a frontier city is made up of
people gathered from the four corners of the
earth: each family is a law unto itself; so that
the speeches Mrs. Trollope carefully set down,
and the customs she depicted, were often peculiarities
of individuals rather than of a community.
But she has left a vivid picture of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
American life in the twenties, less exaggerated
than the picture Charles Dickens gave of it in
the forties. Mrs. Trollope's attitude is no more
hostile than his, but he is more entertaining.
He held us up to ridicule and laughed at us;
she seriously pointed out our errors in the hope
that we might amend. She is slightly inconsistent
at times, for, while asserting the equality
of whites and blacks, she as bitterly resented
the equality of white master and white servant.
Her purpose in writing this book was to warn
her own countrymen of the evils which must
follow a government of the many.</p>

<p>Although she never takes the broad view,
but always the narrow and partial one, her book
gives a good picture of the everyday life and
habits of thought of the next generation to that
which had fought and won the American Revolution.
The white heat of republican fervour,
so obnoxious to a European, welded the nation
together as one people, and filled their hearts
with a religious reverence for the constitution.
She meant them as a reproach, but we read
these words with pride: "I never heard from
anyone a single disparaging word against their
government."</p>

<p>Mrs. Trollope has been described by her
friends as a refined woman of charming personality.
But as soon as she began to write,
she donned her armour and proclaimed her hos<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>tility
either to her hero or to the larger part of
the characters of the book. This method is
dangerous to art. Even the genius of Thackeray
is lessened by his lack of sympathy.</p>

<p>In 1833 Mrs. Trollope published her first
novel, <i>The Refugee in America</i>. It is the story
of an English lord who has fled to America to
escape English justice. He and his friends
have settled in Rochester, New York. It was
written for the sole purpose of describing the
manners of the people of our Eastern cities.
The author's attitude toward them is well
illustrated by a conversation between Caroline,
the young English girl, and her American
<i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;e</i>, Emily. After a dinner in Washington,
Caroline exclaims to her friend:</p>

<p>"'Oh, my own Emily, you must not live and
die where such things be.'</p>

<p>"Emily sighed as she answered, 'I am born
to it, Miss Gordon.'</p>

<p>"'But hardly bred to it. We have caught
you young, and we have spoiled you for ever
as an American lady.'"</p>

<p>Three years later Mrs. Trollope published her
strongest novel, <i>The Life and Adventures of Jonathan
Jefferson Whitlaw</i>. This is a powerful picture
of early life on the Mississippi; it was the
first novel since Mrs. Behn's <i>Oroonoko</i> which
called attention to the evils of African slavery.
It is marred, however, by want of sympathy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
with the community she is describing. Mr. Jonathan
Whitlaw Senior has "squat in the bush,"
an expression to which Mrs. Trollope objects,
but which brings to mind at once the log cabin
in the forest clearing, and the muscular, uncouth
pioneer. Jonathan furnishes firewood
to the Mississippi steamers, and by this means
gains sufficient wealth to carry out his life's
ambition: to set up a store in Natchez, and
to own "niggers." But the life of a pioneer
has made Jonathan as cunning as a fox. This
cunning his son Jonathan, the hero of the story,
has inherited to the full. As a slave-owner he
is as grasping and cruel as Legree, whom Mrs.
Stowe immortalised some years later. His
character, though drawn with strength and
vigour, is inconsistent. He is a miser, yet he is
a gambler and a spendthrift, qualities not often
found together. He is not a true representative
of the son of a pioneer. Clio Whitlaw, the
aunt of the hero, belongs more truly to her environment.
One suspects the English family at
Cincinnati had received neighbourly kindnesses
from women like her. With her physical
strength and great courage she is kind and
neighbourly to all who need her help. The sad
story of Edward Bligh, the young Kentuckian
who preached the gospel to the slaves, the victim
of lynch law, a word dreaded even then, is
as thrilling as parts of <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides <i>Jonathan Jefferson Whitlaw</i>, Mrs.
Trollope created two other characters that will
cause her name to live as long as those of
William Harrison Ainsworth or G. P. R. James.
The coarse scheming widow Barnaby is the
heroine of three novels, <i>Widow Barnaby</i>, <i>The
Widow Married</i>, and <i>The Widow Wedded, or
the Barnabys in America</i>. In the last book Mrs.
Trollope somewhat humorously pays off her
scores against her American critics, who had
dubbed her a cockney, unfamiliar with good society
in either England or America. The Widow
Barnaby, who has come to New Orleans with her
husband after his little gambling ways have made
residence in London unpleasant, decides to earn
some money by writing a book on America.
She describes the Americans, not as they are,
but as they think they are. She listens to all
their boasts about themselves and country,
and puts it faithfully in her book. Of course
they like it and she becomes the literary lion
of America.</p>

<p>Anthony Trollope, in his book <i>An Autobiography</i>,
said of his mother's books on America:
"Her volumes were very bitter; but they were
very clever, and they saved the family from
ruin." She is also given the credit of having
improved the manners of American society.
Whenever a "gentleman" at his club put his
feet on the table, or indulged in any liberty of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
which she would not have approved, others
cried, "Trollope! Trollope! Trollope!"</p>

<p>The <i>Vicar of Wrexhill</i>, the scene of which is
laid in England, is an attack on the evangelical
clergy in the Episcopal Church. The vicar
is no truer to the great body of evangelical
preachers than Jonathan Jefferson Whitlaw is
true to the great body of slave-owners. There
is the same exaggeration to prove a theory.
Evangelical preaching is harmful, is the theorem,
and a man is selected to prove it who in any
walk of life would be a hypocrite and libertine.
The book has many interesting situations.
The vicar's proposal to the rich widow, one of
his parishioners, is clever: "Let me henceforth
be as the shield and buckler that shall guard
thee; so that thou shalt not be afraid for any
terror by night, nor for the arrow that flieth
by day." And he promises, if she will marry
him, to lead her "sinful children into the life
everlasting." No other book has shown, as
this does, the powerful effect upon sensitive
natures of this kind of preaching. One feels
that the followers of the Reverend Vicar were
under the influence of hypnotic suggestion, and
that their awakening from this spell was like the
awakening from a trance.</p>

<p>Mrs. Trollope was actuated by humanitarian
motives. This was not as usual then as since
Dickens popularised the humanitarian novel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
Only three years after he wrote <i>Sketches by
Boz</i>, Mrs. Trollope wrote <i>The Life and Adventures
of Michael Armstrong</i>, the story of a boy
employed in the mills of Lancashire. Negro
slavery in the South, even as Mrs. Trollope saw
it, was a happy state of existence compared
with child slavery in the mills of Ashleigh and
Deep Valley, Lancashire, where the children
were driven to work by the lash in the morning,
and were crippled by the "Billy roller," the
name of the stick by which they were beaten
for inattention to their work during the day.
If the truth of these horrors were not attested
by other writers of this time, one would doubt
the possibility of their existence in the same
land and at the same time in which Wordsworth
was writing of the beauties of his own childhood,
where the river Derwent mingled its murmurs
with his nurse's song.</p>

<p>Mrs. Trollope assailed injustice with a powerful
pen. Woman's moral nature is truer
and more sensitive than man's. Even if her
sympathies cloud her judgment, it is better than
that her judgment should reason away her
sympathies. Neither has woman in her philanthropy
contented herself with broad principles
which would help all and therefore reach none.
The dusky slave in the cotton-fields, the pale-faced
child in the cotton-mills, have alike
touched the hearts of women, who by their pens<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
have been able to awaken the conscience of a
nation. The horror of child labour wrung from
Mrs. Browning the heart-felt poem, <i>The Cry
of the Children</i>. The four strong novels proclaiming
the tyranny of the whites over the
blacks, <i>Oronooko</i>, <i>Jonathan Jefferson Whitlaw</i>,
<i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>, and <i>The Hour and the Man</i>,
were written by women.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The name of Harriet Martineau was a familiar
one in every household during the early years
of Queen Victoria's reign. Like Mrs. Trollope
she was a woman of fearless honesty. But
Harriet Martineau was never the <i>raconteur</i>, she
was first the educator. She wrote story after
story to teach lessons in political and social
science. Her method of work, as set forth
in her autobiography, was peculiar, and the
result is not uninteresting. In her <i>Political
Economy Tales</i>, she selected certain principles
which she wished to set forth, and embodied
each principle in a character. The operations
of these principles furnished the plot of the story.
Besides the illustrations of the principles by the
characters, the laws were discussed in conversation,
and thus the lesson was taught. In the
story <i>Brooke and Brooke Farm</i>, she made use of
an expression which Ruskin almost paraphrased:
"The whole nation, the whole world, is obliged
to him who makes corn grow where it never grew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
before; and yet more to him who makes two ears
ripen where only one ripened before." In the
tale <i>A Manchester Strike</i>, factory life and the
problems that face the working men are set
forth, the aim being to show that work and
wages depend upon the great laws of supply
and demand.</p>

<p>Miss Martineau wrote two novels. <i>Deerbrook</i>,
in 1839, was modelled on <i>Our Village</i>. The
village doctor, Mr. Hope, is the central figure.
Firm in his convictions, he loses the favour of
the leading families, and through their influence
he is deprived of his practice. A fever, however,
sweeps over the place and his former
enemies beg, not in vain, for his skilful services.
A double love story runs through the
book. Mrs. Rowland, a scheming woman, is
the most cleverly drawn of the characters, and
was evidently suggested by some of Miss
Edgeworth's fashionable ladies.</p>

<p>Harriet Martineau also visited America, but
some years later than Mrs. Trollope, when the
slavery agitation was at its height. As she had
written upon the evils of slavery before she left
England, she was invited to attend a meeting
of the Abolitionists in Boston. She accepted
this invitation, and expressed there her abhorrence
of slavery. After this she received
letters from some of the citizens of the pro-slavery
States, threatening her life if she entered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
their domain. This naturally threw her entirely
with the Abolition party, and she wrote
many articles to help their cause.</p>

<p>Miss Martineau's second novel, <i>The Hour and
the Man</i>, grew out of her sympathy and belief
in the coloured race. Toussaint de L'Ouverture,
the devoted slave, soldier, liberator, and martyr,
is the hero. Every scene in which this wonderful
black figures is vividly written. Many
of the minor incidents are but slightly sketched,
and many of the minor characters elude the
reader's grasp. How far this book is a truthful
portrayal of the negro cannot be judged until
the "race problem" is surveyed with unprejudiced
eyes. Then and not until then will its
place in literature be assigned. She gives the
same characterisation of this hero of St. Domingo
as does Wendell Phillips in his wonderful
speech of which the following is the peroration:</p>

<p>"But fifty years hence, when Truth gets a
hearing, the Muse of History will put Phocian
for the Greek, Brutus for the Roman, Hampden
for England, Fayette for France, choose Washington
as the bright, consummate flower of our
earlier civilisation, then, dipping her pen in
the sunlight, will write in the clear blue, above
them all, the name of the soldier, the statesman,
the martyr, <span class="smcap">Toussaint L'Ouverture</span>."</p>

<p><i>The Hour and the Man</i> was published in
1840, and was warmly received by the Aboli<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>tionists.
William Lloyd Garrison, after reading
it, wrote the following sonnet to the author:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
England! I grant that thou dost justly boast<br />
Of splendid geniuses beyond compare;<br />
Men great and gallant,&mdash;women good and fair,&mdash;<br />
Skilled in all arts, and filling every post<br />
Of learning, science, fame,&mdash;a mighty host!<br />
Poets divine, and benefactors rare,&mdash;<br />
Statesmen,&mdash;philosophers,&mdash;and they who dare<br />
Boldly to explore heaven's vast and boundless coast,<br />
To one alone I dedicate this rhyme,<br />
Whose virtues with a starry lustre glow,<br />
Whose heart is large, whose spirit is sublime,<br />
The friend of liberty, of wrong the Foe:<br />
Long be inscribed upon the roll of time<br />
The name, the worth, the works of <span class="smcap">Harriet Martineau</span>.<br />
</p></div>

<p>Miss Martineau wrote on a variety of subjects,
and generally held a view contrary to the
accepted one. She wrote upon mesmerism,
positivism, atheism, which she professed, and
after each book warriors armed with pens
sprang up to assail the author. But she had
many friends, even among those who were most
bitter against her doctrines. One wrote of her,
"There is the fine, honest, solid, North-country
element in her." R. Brimley Johnson in <i>English
Prose</i>, edited by Craik in 1896, said of her
writings:</p>

<p>"Her gift to literature was for her own generation.
She is the exponent of the infant century
in many branches of thought:&mdash;its eager and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
sanguine philanthropy, its awakening interest
in history and science, its rigid and prosaic
philosophy. But her genuine humanity and real
moral earnestness give a value to her more personal
utterances, which do not lose their charm
with the lapse of time."</p>

<p>Harriet Martineau's name and personality
will be remembered in history after her books
have been forgotten.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV</h3>

<h2>The Bront&euml;s</h2>


<p>During the middle of the nineteenth
century, English fiction largely depicted
manners and customs of different classes and
different parts of England. While Dickens,
Thackeray, Disraeli, and Mrs. Gaskell were writing
realistic novels, romantic fiction found noble
exponents in the Bront&euml; sisters.</p>

<p>The quiet life lived by the Bront&euml;s in the
vicarage on the edge of the village of Haworth
in the West Riding of Yorkshire seems prosaic
to the casual observer, but it had many weird
elements of romanticism. The purple moors
stretching away behind the grey stone vicarage,
the grey sky, and the sun always half-frowning,
and never sporting with nature here as it does
over the mountains in Westmoreland, make
thought earnest and deep, and suggest the
mystery which surrounds human life. It is a
serious country, that of the Wharf valley; the
people are a serious people, silent and observant.
The Bront&euml;s were a direct outcome of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
country and people, only in them their severity
and silence were kindled into life by a Celtic
imagination.</p>

<p>What a group of people lived within those
grey stone walls! As the vicar and his four
motherless children gathered about their simple
board, while they engaged in conversation
with each other or with the curate, what scenes
would have been enacted in that quiet room
if the fancies teeming in each childish brain
could have been suddenly endowed with life!
How could even a dull curate, with an undercurrent
of addition and subtraction running in
his brain, based upon his meagre salary and
economical expenditures, have been insensible
to the thought with which the very atmosphere
must have been surcharged? The brother,
Patrick Branwell, found his audience in the public
house, and delighted it with his wit and conversation.
The sisters, after their household
tasks were done, wrote their stories and often
read them to each other.</p>

<p>But fate had chosen her darkest hues in which
to weave the warp and woof of their lives. The
wild dissipations and wilder talk of their brother
Branwell clouded the imaginations of his sisters,
and in a short time death was a constant presence
in their midst. In September, 1848, Branwell
died at the age of thirty; in less than three
months, Emily died at the age of twenty-nine;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
and in five-months, Anne died at the age of
twenty-seven; and Charlotte, the eldest, was
left alone with her father. During the remaining
six years of her life, her compensation for her
loss of companionship was her writing. Not
long after the death of her sisters, Mr. Nicholls
proposed to her; was refused; proposed again
and was accepted; then came the separation
caused by Mr. Bront&euml;'s hostility to the marriage;
then the marriage in the church under whose
pavement so many members of her family were
buried, grim attendants of her wedding; then
the nine short months of married life; then the
death of the last of the Bront&euml; sisters at the
age of thirty-nine. Mr. Bront&euml; outlived her only
six years, but he was the last of his family.
Six children had been born to Patrick Bront&euml;,
not one survived him. Forty years had eliminated
a family which yet lives through the imaginative
powers of the three daughters who
reached years of maturity.</p>

<p>Of the three sisters, the least is known of
Emily, and her one novel, <i>Wuthering Heights</i>,
reveals nothing of herself. Not one of the
characters thought or felt as did the quiet,
retiring author. Yet so great was her dramatic
power that her brother Branwell was credited
with the book, as it was deemed impossible for
a woman to have conceived the character of
Heathcliff. And yet this arch-fiend of litera<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>ture
was created by the daughter of a country
vicar, whose only journeys from home had been
to schools, either as pupil or governess. Charlotte
Bront&euml; has thrown but little light upon
her sister's character. She says that she loved
animals and the moors, but was cold toward
people and repelled any attempt to win her
confidence. The author of <i>Jane Eyre</i> seems
neither to have understood Emily's nature nor
her genius. Yet we are told that Emily was
constantly seen with her arms around the gentle
Anne, and that they were inseparable companions.
If Anne Bront&euml; could have lived
longer, she would have thrown much light upon
the character of the author of <i>Wuthering
Heights</i>. But now, as we read of her brief life
and her one novel, she seems to belong to the
great dramatists rather than to the novelists,
to the poets who live apart from the world and
commune only with the people of their own
creating.</p>

<p><i>Wuthering Heights</i> stands alone in the history
of prose fiction. It belongs to the wild region
of romanticism, but it imitates no book, and
has never been copied. No incident, no character,
no description, can be traced to the
influence of any other book, but the atmosphere
is that of the West Riding of Yorkshire.</p>

<p>Charlotte Bront&euml; thus speaks of it in a letter
to a friend:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Wuthering Heights</i> was hewn in a wild workshop,
with simple tools, out of homely materials.
The statuary found a granite block
on a solitary moor; gazing thereon, he saw how
from the crag might be elicited a head, savage,
swart, sinister: a form moulded with at least
one element of grandeur&mdash;power. He wrought
with a rude chisel, and from no model but the
vision of his meditations. With time and labour,
the crag took human shape, and there it stands,
colossal, dark and frowning, half statue, half
rock, in the former sense, terrible and goblin-like;
in the latter, almost beautiful, for its
colouring is of mellow grey, and moorland moss
clothes it, and heath, with its blooming bells
and balmy fragrance, grows faithfully close
to the giant's foot."</p>

<p>All of this is true, but it gives only the general
outlines, nothing of the inner meaning.</p>

<p>In all literature, there is not so repulsive a
villain as Heathcliff, the offspring of the gipsies.
Insensible to kindness, but resentful of wrong;
hard, scheming, indomitable in resolution; quick
to put off the avenging of an injury until he
can make his revenge serve his purpose; the
personification of strength and power; he is
yet capable of a love stronger than his hate.
Heathcliff is so repulsive that he does not
attract, and drawn with such skill that, as has
been said, he has not been imitated.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>But the strong, dark picture of Heathcliff
makes us forget that Catharine is the centre
of the story. The night that Mr. Lockwood
spends at Wuthering Heights he reads her
books, and her spirit appears to him crying for
entrance at the window, and complaining that
she has wandered on the moors for twenty
years. While living, she represents a human
soul balanced between heaven and hell, loved
by both the powers of darkness and of light.
But in her earliest years, she had loved Heathcliff;
their thoughts, their affections were intertwined,
and they were welded, as it were, into
one soul, not at first by love, but by their
common hatred of Hindley Earnshaw. When
Catharine meets Edgar Linton, her finer nature
asserts itself. She loves him as a being from
another world; he gives her the first glimpse
of real goodness, kindness, and gentleness. She
catches through him a gleam of Paradise. But
she knows how transient this is, and says to
her old nurse, Nelly Dean:</p>

<p>"I've no more business to marry Edgar
Linton than I have to be in heaven; and if the
wicked man in there had not brought Heathcliff
so low, I shouldn't have thought of it. It
would degrade me to marry Heathcliff now;
and that, not because he's handsome, no,
Nelly, but because he's more myself than I am.
Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
are the same, and Linton's is as different as a
moonbeam from lightning, or frost from fire."</p>

<p>But Catharine is married to Edgar, and for
three years her better nature triumphs. Heathcliff
is away; Edgar Linton loves her truly, and
their home is happy. Catharine alone knows
that that house is not her true place of abode.
She alone knows that Edgar has not touched
her inner nature. She knows that her real self,
the self that must abide through the centuries,
is indissolubly linked with another's. And when
Heathcliff returns, the intensity of her joy,
her almost unearthly delight, she neither can
nor attempts to conceal. Not once is she deceived
as to his true nature. She knows the
depth of his depravity, and thus warns the girl
who has fallen in love with him:</p>

<p>"He's not a rough diamond&mdash;a pearl-containing
oyster of a rustic;&mdash;he's a fierce, pitiless,
wolfish man. I never say to him, let this or
that enemy alone, because it would be ungenerous
or cruel to harm them,&mdash;I say, let
them alone, because I should hate them to be
wronged: and he'd crush you, like a sparrow's
egg, Isabella, if he found you a troublesome
charge."</p>

<p>But Catharine's nature is akin to his, and it
is with almost brutal delight that she helps
forward this marriage, when she finds the girl
does not trust her word.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>Then comes the strife between Edgar and
Heathcliff for the soul, so it seems, of Catharine.
There is no jealousy on Edgar's part. The book
never stoops to anything so earthly. Edgar
loathes Heathcliff and cannot understand Catharine's
affection for her early playmate. Although
she never for a moment hesitates in her
allegiance to Heathcliff, it is this strife that
causes her death. The strife between good and
evil wears her out.</p>

<p>Even after her death, her soul cannot leave
this earth. It is still joined to Heathcliff's.
It resembles here the story of Paola and Francesca.
Catharine is waiting for him and his
only delight is in her haunting presence. Heathcliff
cannot be accused of keeping Catharine
from Paradise. In life she would not let him
from her presence, and she clings to him now.
It is the story of <i>Undine</i> reversed. Undine
gained a soul through a mortal's love. And
we feel toward the close that Catharine, selfish
and passionate as she was, is yet Heathcliff's
better spirit. Catharine while living had prevented
Heathcliff from killing her brother.
Although he loved Catharine better than himself,
and would have made any sacrifice at her
request, he feels no more tenderness for her
offspring than for his own. But the spirit of
Catharine lived in her child and nephew, and
when they looked at him with her eyes, he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
no pleasure in his revenge upon the son of
Hindley nor on the daughter of Edgar Linton.</p>

<p>In the tenderness that once or twice comes
over Heathcliff as he looks at Hareton Earnshaw,
there is a ray of promise that he may be
redeemed. And in the final outcome of the
story, one can but hope that Catharine's restless
spirit, as it watches and waits for Heathcliff, is
striving to bring some blessing upon her house.
The awakening of a better nature in Hareton,
through his love for Catharine's daughter, is a
pretty, tender idyl. The book is like a Greek
tragedy in this, that at the close the atmosphere
has been purged; the sun once more shines
through the windows of Wuthering Heights;
hatred is dead, and love reigns supreme.</p>

<p><i>Wuthering Heights</i> is a novel not of externals,
not of character, but of something deeper, more
vital. The love of Catharine and Heathcliff
has no physical basis; it is the union of souls
evil, but not material. It is the sex of spirit,
not of body, that adds its might to the resistless
force that unites these two. Notwithstanding
the external pictures are so distinct that a
painter could transfer them to his canvas, the
book is a soul-tragedy.</p>

<p><i>Wuthering Heights</i> cannot be classed among
the so-called popular novels. It has appealed
to the poets rather than to the readers of fiction.
It has received the warmest praise from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
poet Swinburne. In <i>The Athen&aelig;um</i> of June
16, 1883, he thus eulogises it:</p>

<p>"Now in <i>Wuthering Heights</i> this one thing
needful ['logical and moral certitude'] is as
perfectly and triumphantly attained as in <i>King
Lear</i> or <i>The Duchess of Malfi</i>, in <i>The Bride of
Lammermoor</i> or <i>Notre-Dame de Paris</i>. From
the first we breathe the fresh dark air of tragic
passion and presage; and to the last the changing
wind and flying sunlight are in keeping with
the stormy promise of the dawn. There is no
monotony, there is no repetition, but there is no
discord. This is the first and last necessity,
the foundation of all labour and the crown of all
success, for a poem worthy of the name; and
this it is that distinguishes the hand of Emily
from the hand of Charlotte Bront&euml;. All the
works of the elder sister are rich in poetic spirit,
poetic feeling, and poetic detail; but the younger
sister's work is essentially and definitely a poem
in the fullest and most positive sense of the
term."</p>

<p>At the close of this essay he writes:</p>

<p>"It may be true that not many will ever take
it to their hearts; it is certain that those who do
like it will like nothing very much better in the
whole world of poetry or prose."</p>

<p>All that we know of Emily Bront&euml;'s nature
is consistent, such as we would expect of the
author of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>. The first stanza<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
of her last poem, written but a short time before
her death, reveals her strength of will and
faith:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
No coward soul is mine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No trembler in the world's storm-troubled sphere:</span><br />
I see Heaven's glories shine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And faith shines equal, arming me from fear.</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>These lines evoked the following tribute from
Matthew Arnold:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">&mdash;&mdash;she</span><br />
(How shall I sing her?) whose soul<br />
Knew no fellow for might,<br />
Passion, vehemence, grief,<br />
Daring, since Byron died,<br />
That world-famed son of fire&mdash;she, who sank<br />
Baffled, unknown, self-consumed;<br />
Whose too bold dying song<br />
Stirr'd, like a clarion-blast, my soul.<br />
</p></div>

<p>The great books of prose fiction have been
for the most part the work of mature years.
The lyric poets burst into rhapsody at the dawn
of life; but the powers of the novelist have
ripened more slowly. The novelists have done
better work after thirty-five than at an earlier
age but few of them have written a classic at the
age of twenty-eight, as did Emily Bront&euml;.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Anne Bront&euml;'s fame has been both augmented
and dimmed by the greater genius of her two
sisters. She is remembered principally as one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
of the Bront&euml;s, so that her books have been
oftener reprinted and more extensively read
than their actual merit would warrant. In
comparison with the greater genius of Charlotte
and Emily, her writings have been declared
void of interest, and without any ray of the
brilliancy which distinguishes their books. This
latter statement is not true. Anne Bront&euml; did
not have their imaginative power, but she
reproduced what she had seen and learned of
life with conscientious devotion to truth. <i>Wuthering
Heights</i> and <i>Agnes Grey</i>, Anne Bront&euml;'s
first book, were published together in three
volumes so as to meet the popular demand
that novels, like the graces, should appear in
threes. It is a photographic representation of
the life of a governess in England during the
forties. Agnes's courage in determining to
augment the family income by seeking a position
as governess; the high hopes with which
she enters upon her first position; her conscientious
resolve to do her full Christian duty
to the spoiled children of the Bloomfields; her
dismissal and sad return home; her second
position in the family of Mr. Murray, a country
squire; the two daughters, one determined to
make a fine match for herself, the other a
perfect hoyden without a thought beyond the
horses and dogs; the disregard of the truth in
both; Mr. Hatfield, the minister, who cared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
only for the county families among his parishioners;
Miss Murray's marriage for position and
the unhappiness that followed it&mdash;form a series
of photographs, which only a sensitive, responsive
nature could have produced. The contrast
between the gentle, refined governess, and the
coarse natures upon whom she is dependent, is
well shown, although there is no attempt on the
part of the author to assert any superiority of
one over the other. We have many books in
which the shrinking governess is described from
the point of view of the family or one of their
guests, but here the governess of an English
fox-hunting squire has spoken for herself; she
has described her trials and the constant self-sacrifice
which is demanded of her without
bitterness, and in a kindly spirit withal, and for
that reason the book is a valuable addition to the
history of the life and manners of the century.</p>

<p><i>The Tenant of Wildfell Hall</i>, her second novel,
was a peculiar book to have shaped itself in the
brain of the gentle youngest daughter of the
Vicar of Haworth. But Anne Bront&euml; had seen
phases of life which must have sorely wounded
her pure spirit. She had been governess at Thorp
Green, where her brother Branwell was tutor,
and where he formed that unfortunate attachment
for the wife of his employer, which, with the
help of liquor and opium, deranged his mind.
Anne wrote in her diary at this time, "I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
had some very unpleasant and undreamt-of
experience of human nature." As we picture
Anne Bront&euml;, with her light brown hair, violet-blue
eyes, shaded by pencilled eyebrows, and
transparent complexion, she seems a spirit of
goodness and purity made to behold daily a
depth of evil in the nature of one dear to her,
which fills her with wonderment and horror.</p>

<p>Mr. Huntingdon of Wildfell Hall was drawn
from personal observation of her brother. She
wrote with minuteness, because she believed
it her duty to hold up his life as a warning to
others. The gradual change in Mr. Huntingdon
from the happy confident lover to the ruined
debauchee is well traced; the story of his infatuation
for the wife of his friend, so reckless
that he attempted no concealment, is realistic
in the extreme. But what a change in the novel!
A hundred years before, Huntingdon would
have made a fine hero of romance, but here he
is disgraced to the position of chief villain,
and the reader feels for him only pity and
loathing. Probably a man's pen would have
touched his errors more lightly, but Anne
Bront&euml; painted him as he appeared to her. The
author attributes such a character as Huntingdon's
to false education, and makes her heroine
say:</p>

<p>"As for my son&mdash;if I thought he would grow
up to be what you call a man of the world,&mdash;one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
that has 'seen life,' and glories in his experience,
even though he should so far profit by it as to
sober down, at length, into a useful and respected
member of society&mdash;I would rather
that he died to-morrow&mdash;rather a thousand
times."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding its defects&mdash;and it is full
of them judged from the stand-point of art&mdash;<i>Wildfell
Hall</i> is a book of promise. In the
descriptions of the Hall, the mystery that surrounds
its mistress, the rumours of her unknown
lover, the heathclad hills and the desolate fields,
there are romantic elements that remind one of
<i>Wuthering Heights</i>. The book is more faulty
than <i>Agnes Grey</i>, but the writer had a deeper
vision of life with its weaknesses and its depths of
human passion. If years had mellowed that
"undreamt-of experience" of Thorp Green,
Anne Bront&euml; with her truthful observation and
sympathetic insight into character might have
written a classic. The material out of which
<i>Wildfell Hall</i> was wrought, under a more mature
mind, with a better grasp of the whole and a
better regard for proportion, would have made
a novel worthy of a place beside <i>Jane Eyre</i>.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>That English fiction has produced sweeter
and more varied fruit by being grafted with the
novels of women no one who gives the matter
a serious thought can for a moment doubt.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
One distinctive phase of woman's mind made
its way but slowly in the English novel. Women
are by nature introspective. They read character
and are quick to grasp the motives and
passions that underlie action. The French
women have again and again embodied this
view of human nature in their novels, which
are essentially of the inner life. <i>The Princess
of Cl&egrave;ves</i> by Madame de Lafayette, written in
1678, is the first book in which all the conflicts
are those of the emotions; here the great triumph
is that which a woman wins over her own heart.
Madame de Tencin in <i>M&eacute;moires du Comte de
Comminges</i> represents her hero and heroine
under the influence of two great passions, religion
and love. Madame de Souza, Madame
Cottin, Madame de Genlis, Madame de Sta&euml;l, and
George Sand wrote novels of the inner life.
The Princess of Cl&egrave;ves with noble dignity controls
her emotion and at last conquers it. The
pages of George Sand thrill with unbridled
passion.</p>

<p>The English women, however, are more repressed
by nature than the French, and the
English novel of the inner life advanced but
slowly. The emotions of the long-forgotten
Sidney Biddulph are minutely told. <i>A Simple
Story</i> by Mrs. Inchbald is a psychological novel.
Amelia Opie, Mary Brunton, and Mrs. Shelley
wrote novels of the inner life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p>But <i>Jane Eyre</i> is the first English novel which
in sustained intensity of emotion can compare
with the novels of Madame de Sta&euml;l or George
Sand. The style partakes of the high-wrought
character of the heroine, and the reader is
whirled along in the vortex of feeling until he
too partakes of every varied mood of the characters,
and closes the book fevered and exhausted.
It is one of the ironies of fate that
Charlotte Bront&euml; with her strong pro-Anglican
prejudices should belong to the school of these
French women. But there is the same difference
between their writings that there is between
the French temperament and the English. Even
in the wildest moments of Jane Eyre her passion
is rather like the river Wharf when it has overflowed
its banks; while theirs is like the mountain
torrent that bears all down before it.</p>

<p>Much of the passion that Charlotte Bront&euml;
describes is pure imagination. She wrote freely
to her friends about herself and the people whom
she knew. The three rejected suitors caused
her only a little amusement. Her love for Mr.
Nicholls, whom she afterwards married, was
little warmer than respect. We could as easily
weave a romance out of Jane Austen's remark
that the poet Crabbe was a man whom she could
marry as to make a love story out of Charlotte's
relations to Monseiur H&eacute;ger, who figures as the
hero in three of her books. Here she is greater<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
than the French women writers: they knew by
experience what they wrote; she by innate
genius.</p>

<p>Perhaps no novelist ever had more meagre
materials out of which to make four novels than
had Charlotte Bront&euml;: her sisters, Monsieur and
Madame H&eacute;ger, the curates, and herself; a small
village in Yorkshire, two boarding schools, two
positions as governess, and a short time spent
in a school in Brussels. Compare this range
with the material that Scott, Dickens, or
Thackeray had&mdash;then judge how much of the
elixir of genius was given to each.</p>

<p>The early pages of <i>Jane Eyre</i>, the first novel
which Charlotte Bront&euml; published, describe
Lowood Institution, a place modelled upon
Cowan's Bridge School. The two teachers, the
kind Miss Temple and the cruel Miss Scatcherd,
were drawn from two instructors there at the
time the Bront&euml;s attended it. Helen Burns,
so untidy but so meek in spirit, was Maria
Bront&euml;, the eldest sister, who died at the age
of eleven, probably as a result of the poor food
and harsh treatment of the school. With what
calm she replies to Jane, when she would sympathise
with her for an unjust punishment:</p>

<p>"I am, as Miss Scatcherd said, slatternly; I
seldom put, and never keep, things in order;
I am careless; I forget rules; I read when I
should learn my lessons; I have no method; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
sometimes I say, like you, I cannot bear to be
subjected to systematic arrangements. This
is all very provoking to Miss Scatcherd, who is
naturally neat, punctual, and particular."</p>

<p>Helen Burns, with her calm submission, and
Jane Eyre, with her rebellious spirit, are finely
contrasted. Jane's passionate resentment of the
punishments which Miss Scatcherd inflicted on
Helen was genuine. Charlotte was nine years
old when she left Cowan's Bridge School, but
her suppressed anger at the punishments which
her sister Maria had received there flashed out
years afterwards in <i>Jane Eyre</i>.</p>

<p>Charlotte Bront&euml; was writing <i>Jane Eyre</i> at
the same time that Emily and Anne were writing
<i>Wuthering Heights</i> and <i>Agnes Grey</i>. As they
read from their manuscripts, Charlotte objected
to beauty as a requisite of a heroine, and said,
"I will show you a heroine as plain and as small
as myself, who shall be as interesting as any
of yours." So arose the conception of Jane
Eyre. If the slight, shy, Yorkshire governess,
without beauty or charm of manner, had appeared
before the imagination of any novelist
either male or female, at that time, and asked
to be admitted into the house of fiction, she
would have been refused entrance as cruelly as
Hannah shut the door in the face of Jane Eyre,
when she came to her dripping with the rain,
cold and weak from two nights' exposure on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
moor, and asking for charity. But Charlotte
Bront&euml;, with a woman's sympathetic eye made
doubly penetrating and loving by genius, chose
this outcast from romance as a heroine, a woman
without beauty or charm, and boldly proclaimed
that moral beauty was superior to physical
beauty, and that the attraction of one soul for
another lay quite beyond the pale of external
form.</p>

<p>Jane Eyre is not, however, Charlotte Bront&euml;,
as has been so often asserted. She would not
have gone back to comfort Mr. Rochester, after
she had once left the Hall. One suspects that
he was drawn from reading, since the author
hardly trusted her knowledge of worldly men
to draw a fitting lover for Jane. Mr. Rochester
is very much the same type of man as Mr. B.,
whom Pamela married, and the independent
Jane addresses him as "My Master," an expression
constantly on the lips of Pamela. Yet
Rochester leaves a permanent impression on the
mind, for he represents a strong man at war
with destiny. He conceals his marriage because
of his determination to conquer fate. It is
pointed out by critics to-day that he is quite an
impossible character, that he is, in fact, a
woman's hero. It is well to remember, however,
that the author of <i>Jane Eyre</i> was believed
at first to have been a man, as it was thought
impossible for a man like Rochester to have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
been conceived in a woman's brain, and not
until Mrs. Gaskell's life of the Bront&euml;s was
published was Charlotte's character as a modest
woman established. But men have repudiated
Mr. Rochester, and so we must accept their
judgment.</p>

<p>The heroine of her next novel, <i>Shirley</i>, was
suggested by Emily Bront&euml;. Only Shirley was
not Emily. Shirley could not have conceived
even the dim outlines of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, but
she had many of the strong qualities of Emily,
and these, mingled with the softer stuff of her
own nature, make her contradictory but charming,
and Louis Moore, an agreeable tutor whom
Emily Bront&euml; would have quite despised,
naturally falls in love with his wayward pupil,
as they pore over books in the school-room.
Shirley is contrasted with Caroline Helstone,
of whom Mrs. Humphry Ward says: "For
delicacy, poetry, divination, charm, Caroline
stands supreme among the women of Miss
Bront&euml;'s gallery." Even if other admirers of
Miss Bront&euml; deny her this eminence, she certainly
possesses all the qualities, rare among
heroines, which Mrs. Ward has attributed to her.</p>

<p>In many of the conversations between Shirley
and Caroline, there are reminders of what passed
between the Bront&euml; sisters in their own home.
The relative excellence of men and women
novelists always interested them. Shirley<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
evidently expressed Charlotte's own views in
the following words:</p>

<p>"If men could see us as we really are, they
would be a little amazed; but the cleverest,
the acutest men are often under an illusion
about women. They do not read them in a true
light; they misapprehend them, both for good
and evil: their good woman is a queer thing, half
doll, half angel; their bad woman almost always
a fiend. Then to hear them fall into ecstasies
with each other's creations, worshipping the
heroine of such a poem&mdash;novel&mdash;drama, thinking
it fine,&mdash;divine! Fine and divine it may be,
but often quite artificial&mdash;false as the rose in my
best bonnet there. If I spoke all I think on
this point, if I gave my real opinion of some
first-rate female characters in first-rate works,
where should I be? Dead under a cairn of
avenging stones in half-an-hour."</p>

<p>"After all," says Caroline, "authors' heroines
are almost as good as authoresses' heroes."</p>

<p>"Not at all," Shirley replies. "Women read
men more truly than men read women. I'll
prove that in a magazine article some day when
I've time; only it will never be inserted; it will
be 'declined with thanks,' and left for me at
the publisher's."</p>

<p>The greater part of the men in <i>Shirley</i> were
drawn from life, and are as true to their sex as
were the heroines of Dickens, Thackeray, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
Disraeli, who were then writing. As for the
curates, they are perfect. No man's hand
could have executed their portraits so skilfully.
They have no more real use in the story than
they seem to have had in their respective parishes.
But this daughter of a country vicar,
who knew nothing of the London cockney, who
was then enlivening the books of Dickens,
seized upon the funniest people she knew, the
curates, and they have been immortalised.</p>

<p>There is often in Charlotte Bront&euml;'s novels a
separation of plot and character, as if they
formed themselves independently in her mind.
This is especially true of <i>Shirley</i>. At that time
the attention of England was directed toward
the manufacturing towns of Lancashire and
Yorkshire. Mrs. Trollope and Harriet Martineau
had written upon conditions of life
there. In <i>Sybil</i> Disraeli considered broadly
the underlying causes of the misery of the
operatives. Mrs. Gaskell wrote <i>Mary Barton</i>,
a story of Manchester life, the same year that
Charlotte Bront&euml; was writing <i>Shirley</i>. The plot
of the last named is laid in the early years of
the nineteenth century, and turns upon the
opposition of the workmen to the introduction
of machinery. But the plot and characters are
constantly getting in each other's way and
tripping each other up. Though the book is full
of defects, one cannot judge it harshly. When<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
she began the funny description of the curates'
tea-drinking, her brother and sisters were with
her. Before it was finished, she and her father
were left alone. But at this time the public
demanded melodrama. Fires, drownings, and
death-beds were popular methods of untying
hard knots and of playing upon the emotions of
the reader. She, like Mrs. Gaskell, constantly
resorts to outside circumstances to help put
things to rights when they are drifting in the
wrong direction, circumstances which Jane
Austen would not have admitted in a book of
hers.</p>

<p>Before Charlotte Bront&euml; wrote <i>Jane Eyre</i> or
<i>Shirley</i>, she had finished <i>The Professor</i>, and
offered it to different publishers, but it was
rejected by all. Finally she herself lost faith
in it, and transformed it into the beautiful story
of <i>Villette</i>, where the school of Madame and
Monseiur H&eacute;ger in Brussels is made immortal.
In the plot of <i>Villette</i>, as in the plot of <i>Jane
Eyre</i> and of <i>Shirley</i>, many extraneous events
happen which are either unexpected or unnecessary.
Like <i>Jane Eyre</i>, <i>Villette</i> is steeped
in the romantic spirit, but the hard light of
reason again dispels the illusion. In the management
of the supernatural Charlotte is far
inferior to Emily. The explanation of the nun
in <i>Villette</i> is even childish. It is the mistake
made by Mrs. Radcliffe, by nearly all writers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
of the age of reason. They give a ray, as it
were, a whisper from the mysterious world
which surrounds that which is manifest to our
everyday senses. Be it the fourth dimension,
or what not, we catch for a moment a message
from this other world, which, even indistinct,
still tells us that this visible world is not all, that
there is something beyond. Then, with hard
common-sense, they deny their own message,
and, so doing, deny to us the world of mystery,
and leave us only the material world in which
to believe. Not so Emily Bront&euml;. Not so
Scott or Shakespeare. We may believe in
Hamlet's ghost or not; we may believe or not
in the White Lady of Avenel; we may believe
or not that Catharine's soul hovered near Heathcliff.
But we are still left with a belief in the
life after death, and still believe in something
beyond experience, and still grope to find those
things in heaven and earth of which philosophy
does not dream.</p>

<p>But the characters, not the plot, remain in
the mind, after reading <i>Villette</i>. Madame Beck,
whose prototype was Madame H&eacute;ger, is as
clever as Cardinal Wolsey or Cardinal Richelieu;
but she uses all her diplomatic skill in the
management of a lady's school, which, under
her ever watchful eye, with the aid of duplicate
keys to the trunks and drawers of the teachers
and pupils, runs without friction of any kind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
Lucy Snowe, the English teacher in <i>Villette</i>, is
far more pleasing than Jane Eyre; she is not so
passionate, but her view of life is deeper and
broader, and consequently kinder. And there
is Paul Emanuel. Who would have believed the
rejected professor would have grown into that
scholar of middle age? He is so distinctly the
foreigner in showing every emotion under which
he is labouring. How pathetic and how lovable
he is on the day of his f&ecirc;te when he thinks that
the English governess has forgotten him, and
has not brought even a flower to make the day
happier for him! So fretful in little things, so
heroic in large things, with so many faults which
every pupil can see, but with so many virtues,
frank even about his little deceptions, he is a
lovable man. But many of Miss Bront&euml;'s
readers do not find Paul Emanuel as delightful
as Paulina, the womanly little girl who grows
into the childlike woman. She is as sensitive
as the mimosa plant to the people about her.
Every event of her childhood, all the people she
cared for then, remained indelibly imprinted on
her mind, so that, with her, friendship and love
are strong and abiding.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding their many defects, Charlotte
Bront&euml;'s novels have left a permanent
impression upon English fiction and have won
an acknowledged place among English classics.
She first made a minute analysis of the varying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
emotions of men and women, and noted the
strange, unaccountable attractions and repulsions
which everybody has experienced. Paulina,
a girl of six, is happy at the feet of Graham, a
boy of sixteen, although he is unconscious of her
presence. And so instance after instance can
be given of affinities and antipathies which lie
beyond human reason. She, like her sister
Emily, though with less clear vision, was searching
for the hidden sources of human feeling
and human action.</p>

<p>Charlotte Bront&euml; wrote to a friend:</p>

<p>"I always through my whole life liked to
penetrate to the real truth; I like seeking the
goddess in her temple, and handling the veil,
and daring the dread glance."</p>

<p>Her truthfulness in painting emotion, which
to her own generation seemed most daring,
even coarse, has given an abiding quality to her
work. And besides she created Paulina and
Paul Emanuel.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI</h3>

<h2>Mrs. Gaskell</h2>


<p>Ever since Eve gave Adam of the forbidden
fruit, "and he did eat," the relative
position of the sexes has rankled in the heart
of man. The sons of Adam proclaim loudly
that they were given dominion over the earth
and all that the earth contained; but they have
been ever ready to follow blindly the beckoning
finger of some fair daughter of Eve. Perhaps
it is a consciousness of this domination of the
weaker sex that has led man to proclaim in such
loud tones his mastery over woman, having
some doubts of its being recognised by her
unless asserted in bold language. At a time
when the novels of women received as warm a
welcome from the public and as large checks
from the publishers as those of men, a writer
whose sex need not be given thus discussed
their relative merits:</p>

<p>"What is woman, regarded as a literary
worker? Simply an inferior animal, educated
as an inferior animal. And what is man? He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
is a superior being, educated by a superior
being. So how can they ever be equal in that
particular line?"</p>

<p>Granted the premises, there can be but one
conclusion.</p>

<p>The perfect assurance with which men have
asserted their own sufficiency in all lines of art
would be amusing if it had not been so disastrous
in distorting and warping at least three
of them: music, the drama, and prose fiction.
As slow as the growth of spirituality, has been
the recognition of woman's mental and moral
power. It seems almost incredible that not
many years ago only male voices were heard in
places of amusement. Deep, rich, full, and
sonorous, no one disputes the beauty of the male
chorus; but modern opera would be impossible
without the soprano and alto voices, and Madame
Patti, Madame Sembrich, and Madame
Lehman have proved that in natural gifts and
in the technique of art women are not inferior
to their brethren.</p>

<p>By the same slow process women have won
recognition on the stage. Even in Shakespeare's
time men saw no reason why women
should acquire the histrionic art. Imagine
Juliet played by a boy! Yet Essex, Leicester,
Southampton, in the boxes, the groundlings
in the pit, and Ben Jonson sitting as
critic of all, were well satisfied with it, for they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
were used to it, just as men have accepted
the heroines of their own novels, though every
woman they meet is a refutation of their truth.
It only needed a woman in a woman's part to
open the eyes of the audience to all they had
missed before. Not until the Restoration, did
any woman appear on the English stage. The
following lines given in the prologue written
for the revival of <i>Othello</i>, in which the part of
Desdemona was acted for the first time by a
woman, show how quick critics were to see the
folly of the old custom:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
For to speak truth, men act, that are between<br />
Forty and fifty, wenches of fifteen,<br />
With bone so large, and nerve so uncompliant,<br />
When you call Desdemona, enter Giant.<br />
</p></div>

<p>As we cannot conceive of the English stage
without such women as Mrs. Siddons, Charlotte
Cushman, and Ellen Terry, so we cannot conceive
of the English novel without such writers
as Maria Edgeworth, Jane Austen, Mary Mitford,
the Bront&euml;s, Elizabeth Gaskell, and George
Eliot, each one of whom carried some phase
of the novel to so high a point that she has stood
pre-eminent in her own particular line. Too
often we confuse art with its subject-matter.
If it requires as much skill to give interest to the
everyday occurrences of the home as to the
thrilling adventures abroad; to depict the life<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
of women as the life of men; to reveal the joys
and sorrows of a woman's heart as the exultations
and griefs of man's; then these women
deserve a place equal to that held by Richardson,
Fielding, Scott, Dickens, and Thackeray.
Their art, as their subject-matter, is different.
With the exception of George Eliot, they have
not virility with its strength and power, but
they have femininity, no less strong and powerful,
a quality possessed by Scott, but by no
other of these masculine writers, with the
possible exception of Dickens, and in him it is
a femininity, which tends to run to sentimentalism,
a different characteristic.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Elizabeth Gaskell, one of the most feminine
of writers, is so well known as the author of
<i>Cranford</i>, that delightful village whose only
gentleman dies early in the story, that many
of its readers do not know that its author was
better known by her contemporaries through
her humanitarian novels; in which she discussed
the great problems that face the poor.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gaskell, whose maiden name was Stevenson,
was born in Chelsea in 1810. She
spent the greater part of her childhood and girlhood
at the home of her mother's family, Knutsford
in Cheshire, the place she afterward made
famous under the name of Cranford. In 1832,
she married the Reverend William Gaskell,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
minister of the Unitarian chapel in Manchester,
and that city became her home. She took an
active interest in all the affairs of the city, and
constantly visited the poor. Her husband's
father, besides being the professor of English
History and Literature in Manchester New
College, a Unitarian institution, was a manufacturer;
thus Mrs. Gaskell had the opportunity
of hearing both sides of the controversy which
was then waging between labour and capital.</p>

<p>In the early forties, there was much suffering
among the "mill-hands"; many were dying of
starvation, and consequently there were many
strikes and uprisings. These conditions led to
her writing her first novel, <i>Mary Barton</i>. The
book was written during the years 1845-1847,
although it was not published until 1848. The
nucleus of it, Mrs. Gaskell wrote to a friend,
was John Barton. Since she herself was constantly
wondering at the inequalities of fortune,
which permitted some to starve, while others
had abundance, how must it affect an ignorant
man, himself on the verge of starvation, and
filled with pity for the sufferings of his friends?
Driven almost insane by the condition of society,
and hoping to remedy it, he commits a crime,
which preys so upon his conscience that it finally
wears out his own life.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gaskell in this, her first novel, has left
an undying picture of that section of smoky<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
Manchester where the mill-workers live: its
narrow lanes; small but not uncomfortable
cottages, well supplied with furniture in days
when work was plentiful, but destitute even of
a fire when it was scarce; the undersized men
and women, with irregular features, pale blue
eyes, sallow complexions, but with an intelligence
rendered quick and sharp by their life
among the machinery, and by their hard struggle
for existence. The life of the poor had
often furnished a theme for the poets, but it was
the life of shepherds and milkmaids, above whom
the blue sky arched, and whose labours were
brightened by the songs of the birds, and the
colours and sweet odours of fruit and flowers.
But Mrs. Gaskell described the life of the poor
in a town where factory smoke obscured the
light of the sun, and where the weariness of
labour was rendered more intense by the clanging
factory bell, and the constant whirr of machinery
ringing in their ears. It is a gloomy picture,
but no gloomier than the reality.</p>

<p>Disraeli in <i>Sybil</i> discussed the questions of
labour and capital in their relations to the history
of England, with a broad intellectual grasp
of the sociological causes which produced these
conditions. He wrote in the interests of two
classes, the Crown and the People, with the
hope that England might again have a free
monarchy and a prosperous people. It is a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
well illustrated treatise on government, but the
principles advocated or discussed always overshadow
the characters. He had no such intimate
knowledge of the lives of the poor as had Mrs.
Gaskell. She conducts us to the homes of John
Barton, George Wilson, and Job Legh, shows
the simplicity of their lives, and their sense of
the injustice under which they are suffering, and
their helpfulness to each other in times of need.</p>

<p>How simple and true is the friendship that
binds Mary Barton, the dressmaker's apprentice;
Margaret, the blind singer; and Alice
Wilson, the aged laundress, whose mind is constantly
dwelling on the green fields and running
brooks of her childhood's home. These women
possess the strength of character of the early
Teutonic women. They are reticent, not given
to the exchange of confidences, but ready to
help a friend with all they have in the hour of
need. When Margaret thinks that the Bartons
are in want of money, she says to Mary, "Remember,
if you're sore pressed for money, we
shall take it very unkind if you do not let us
know." But she does not question her. Later
when her great trouble comes to Mary Barton,
which she must bear alone, when she must free
a lover from the charge of murder without incriminating
her father, she shows presence of
mind, clearness of vision, and both moral and
physical courage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>Jem Wilson, the hero of the story, is as strong
as Mary Barton, the heroine. Although Dickens
was writing of the poor, he always found some
means to educate his heroes, and generally
placed them among gentlemen. Jem Wilson's
education was received in the factory, and the
little rise he made above his fellows was due to
his better understanding of machinery. He
was a working man, proud of his skill, and of his
good name for honesty and sobriety.</p>

<p>The plot of <i>Mary Barton</i> is highly melodramatic,
and its technique is open to criticism.
It should not be read, however, for the story,
but for the many home scenes in which we come
into close sympathy with the men and women
of Manchester. There is no novel in which we
feel more strongly the heart-beats of humanity.
It leaves the impression, not of art, but of life.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gaskell turned again to the struggles
between labour and capital for the plot of her
novel <i>North and South</i>. Between this story
and <i>Mary Barton</i> she had written <i>Cranford</i> and
<i>Ruth</i>, but her mind seemed to revert, as it were,
from the peaceful village life to the stirring
mill-towns of Lancashire. The great contrast
between life in the counties of England presided
over by the landed gentry, and that in
the counties where the manufacturers formed
the aristocracy, suggested this book. It was
published in 1855, seven years after
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
<i>Mary Barton</i>. The plot of <i>North and South</i> is better
proportioned than is that of <i>Mary Barton</i>.
There are fewer characters, better contrasted.
It is a brighter picture, with more humour, but
it does not leave so strong an impression on the
mind as does the earlier work. Both, however,
are more accurate than <i>Hard Times</i>, a book
with which Dickens himself was highly dissatisfied.
He knew little of the life in the
manufacturing districts, but, in a spirit of indignation
at the poverty brought on by grasping
manufacturers, he caricatured the entire class
in the persons of Mr. Gradgrind and Mr. Bounderby.
When these men are compared with
the manufacturers as represented in <i>North and
South</i>, Mrs. Gaskell's more intimate knowledge
of them is at once apparent.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gaskell had been accused of taking sides
with the working men, and representing their
point of view in <i>Mary Barton</i>. In <i>North and
South</i>, the hero, Mr. Thornton, is a rich manufacturer,
a fine type of the self-made man, but
standing squarely on his right to do what he
pleases in his own factory. "He looks like a
person who would enjoy battling with every
adverse thing he could meet with&mdash;enemies,
winds, or circumstances," was Margaret Hale's
comment when she first met him. "He's
worth fighting wi', is John Thornton," said
one of the leaders of the strike. For although<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
the condition of affairs in the mill-towns had
much improved since John Barton went to
London as a delegate from his starving townsmen,
and was refused a hearing by Parliament,
a large part of the book is concerned with the
story of a strike, which in its outcome brought
starvation to many of the men, and bankruptcy
to some of the masters, the acknowledged
victors.</p>

<p>Higgins, one of the leaders of the working men,
is a true Lancashire man, and like Thornton,
the leader of the masters, has many traits of
character as truly American as English. His
sturdy independence is well shown in Margaret's
first interview with him. The daughter of a
vicar in the south of England, she had been
accustomed to call upon the poor in her father's
parish. Learning that Higgins's daughter,
Bessy, is ill she expresses her desire to call
upon her. "I'm none so fond of having
stranger folk in my house," Higgins informs
her, but he finally relents and says, "Yo may
come if yo like."</p>

<p>But besides the conflict between the manufacturers
and their employees, with which much
of the book is concerned, there is the sharp
contrast between the Hales, born and bred in
the south of England, and the mill-owners in
whose society they are placed. Mr. Hale,
indecisive, inactive, in whom thought is more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
powerful than reality, is as helpless as a child
among these men of action, and utterly unable
to cope with the problems they are facing.
Margaret, the refined daughter of a poor clergyman,
is contrasted with the proud Mrs. Thornton,
the mother of a wealthy manufacturer, who
would make money, not birth, the basis of
social distinctions. But Margaret is even better
contrasted with the poor factory girl, Bessy
Higgins, who turns to her for help and sympathy.
There is hardly a story of Mrs. Gaskell's which
is not adorned by the friendship of the heroine
for some other woman in the book.</p>

<p>In both these novels, she taught that the only
solution of the great problem of capital and
labour was a recognition of the fact that their
interests were identical, and that friendly intercourse
was the only means of breaking down
the barrier that divided them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gaskell was so versatile, she touched
upon so many problems of human life, that it
is almost impossible to summarise her work.
<i>Ruth</i> considers the question of the girl who has
been betrayed. Ruth is as pure as Tess of the
D'Urbervilles, and like her is a victim of circumstances.
A stranger who has taken her
under her protection reports that Ruth is a
widow, and Ruth passively acquiesces in the
deception, hoping that her son may never know
the disgrace of his birth. But the truth comes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
to light, involving in temporary disgrace Ruth
and her son, and the household of Mr. Benson,
the dissenting minister whose home had been
her place of refuge. But Mrs. Gaskell is always
optimistic. By her good deeds, Ruth wins the
love and honour of the entire community. This
novel was loudly assailed. It was claimed that
Mrs. Gaskell had condoned immorality, and it
was considered dangerous teaching that good
deeds were an atonement for such a sin. But
if <i>Ruth</i> found detractors, it also found warm
admirers, who recognised the broader teachings
of the story. Mrs. Jameson wrote to Mrs.
Gaskell:</p>

<p>"I hope I do understand your aim&mdash;you have
lifted up your voice against 'that demoralising
laxity of principle,' which I regard as the ulcer
lying round the roots of society; and you have
done it wisely and well, with a mingled courage
and delicacy which excite at once my gratitude
and my admiration."</p>

<p>The scene of <i>Sylvia's Lovers</i> is laid in Whitby,
at a time when the press-gang was kidnapping
men for the British navy. It is a story of the
loves, jealousies, and sorrows of sailors, shopkeepers,
and small farmers, among whom Sylvia
moves as the central figure. Du Maurier, who
illustrated the second edition of this novel, was
so charmed with the heroine that he named
his daughter Sylvia for her. This story, like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
<i>Ruth</i>, has much of the sentimentalism so fashionable
in the middle of the nineteenth century.
The leading canon of criticism at that time was
the power with which a writer could move the
emotions of the reader, and the novelist was
expected either to convulse his readers with
laughter or dissolve them into tears. There
are many funny scenes in <i>Sylvia's Lovers</i>, but
the key-note is pathos. Like many novels of
Dickens, there are death-bed scenes introduced
only for the luxury of weeping over sorrows
that are not real, and there are melodramatic
situations as in her other books. Parts of this
novel suggested to Tennyson the poem of
<i>Enoch Arden</i>.</p>

<p>But, however powerful may be the novels
dealing with the questions that daily confront
the poor, there is a perennial charm in the society
of people who dwell amid rural scenes.
Mrs. Gaskell has written several short stories
of the pastoral type. Such a story is <i>Cousin
Phillis</i>. It is a beautiful idyl and reminds one
of the old pastorals in which ladies and gentlemen
played at shepherds and shepherdesses.
Cousin Phillis cooks, irons, reads Dante, helps
the haymakers, falls in love, and mends a broken
heart, and is brave, true, and unselfish. Her
father is what one would expect from such a
daughter. He cultivates his small farm, finds
rest from his labours in reading, and neglects<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
none of the many duties which belong to him
as the dissenting minister of a small village.</p>

<p><i>Cranford</i> and <i>Wives and Daughters</i> have this
in common, that the scene of both is laid in the
village of Knutsford. The former is a rambling
story of events in two or three households, and
of the social affairs in which all the village is
concerned. It is without doubt the favourite
of Mrs. Gaskell's novels. <i>Wives and Daughters</i>
was Mrs. Gaskell's last story, and was left unfinished
at her death. It shows a great artistic
advance over her earlier work. The plot is
more natural; it has not so many sharp contrasts,
which George Eliot criticised in Mrs.
Gaskell's stories. The characters are also more
subtle. Molly, the daughter of the village
doctor, is an unselfish, thoughtful girl, but with
none of that unreal goodness which Dickens
sometimes gave to his heroines. When she
receives her first invitation to a child's party,
and her father is wondering whether or not she
can go, her speech is characteristic of her nature:</p>

<p>"Please, Papa,&mdash;I do wish to go&mdash;but I don't
care about it."</p>

<p>Molly feels very keenly, and longs for things
with all the strength of an ardent nature, but
she always subordinates herself and her wishes
to others. In the character of Cynthia, Mrs.
Gaskell makes a plea for the heartless coquette.
Cynthia is beautiful, she likes to please those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
in whose company she finds herself, but quickly
forgets the absent. It is not her fault that
young men's hearts are brittle, for it is as natural
for her to smile, and be gay and forget, as it is
for Molly to love, be silent, and remember. So
it is Cynthia who has the lovers, while Molly
is neglected. Clare, Cynthia's mother, is more
selfish than her daughter, but she has learned
the art of seeming to please others while thinking
only of pleasing herself. She is as crafty as
Becky Sharp, but softer, more feline, and more
subtle; a much commoner type in real life
than Thackeray's diplomatic heroine.</p>

<p>Mr. A. W. Ward, in the biographical introduction
to the Knutsford Edition of her novels,
says of her later work:</p>

<p>"When Mrs. Gaskell had become conscious
that if true to herself, to her own ways of looking
at men and things, to the sympathies and
hopes with which life inspired her, she had but
to put pen to paper, she found what it has been
usual to call her later manner&mdash;the manner of
which <i>Cranford</i> offered the first adequate illustration,
and of which <i>Cousin Phillis</i> and <i>Wives
and Daughters</i> represent the consummation."</p>

<p>The same critic compares the later work of
Mrs. Gaskell with the later work of George
Sand and finds that "in their large-heartedness"
they are similar. He also gives George Sand's
tribute to her English contemporary. "Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
Gaskell," she said, "has done what neither I
nor other female writers in France can accomplish:
she has written novels which excite the
deepest interest in men of the world, and yet
which every girl will be the better for reading."</p>

<p>It is not often that a novelist finds another
writer to take up and enlarge her work as did
Mrs. Gaskell. Her novels contain the germ of
much of George Eliot's earlier writings. <i>The
Moorland Cottage</i> suggested many parts of <i>The
Mill on the Floss</i>. Edward and Maggie Brown&mdash;the
former important, consequential and dictatorial,
the latter self-forgetful, eager to help
others, and by her very eagerness prone to
blunders&mdash;were developed by George Eliot into
the characters of Tom and Maggie Tulliver.
The weak and fretful mothers in the two books
are much alike, while the love story and the
catastrophe have the same general outline.</p>

<p>They both drew largely from the working
people of the North or of the Midlands, and
both constantly introduced Dissenters. Silas
Marner belongs to the manufacturing North,
and the people of Lantern Yard are of the same
class as those of Manchester and Milton. Felix
Holt and Adam Bede belong to the same type
as Jem Wilson and Mr. Thornton, while Esther
Lyon is not unlike Margaret Hale. Both often
presented life from the point of view of the poor.</p>

<p>Both were interested in the development of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
character, and in the changes which it underwent
for good or evil under the influence of
outward circumstances. But George Eliot had
greater intellectual power than Mrs. Gaskell.
She had the broader view and the deeper insight.
Mrs. Gaskell could never have conceived the
plots nor the characters of <i>Romola</i> nor <i>Middlemarch</i>.
She constantly introduced extraneous
matter to shape her plots according to her will,
while with George Eliot the fate of character is
as hard and unyielding as was the fate of predestination
in the sermons of the old Calvinistic
divines. Mrs. Gaskell, like Dickens, introduced
death-bed scenes merely to play upon the emotions.
George Eliot was never guilty of this
defect; with her, character is a fatalism that is
inexorable.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Gaskell had a more hopeful view
of life than had George Eliot. The Unitarians
believe in man and have faith in the clemency
of God. This makes them a cheerful people.
However dark the picture that Mrs. Gaskell
paints, we have faith that conditions will soon
be better, and at the close of the book we see
the dawn of a brighter day. George Eliot had
taken the suggestions of Mrs. Gaskell and amplified
them with many details that the woman
of lesser genius had omitted. But to each was
given her special gift. If George Eliot's characters
stand out as more distinct personalities,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
they are drawn with less sympathy. George
Eliot's men and women are often hard and sharp
in outline; Mrs. Gaskell's, no matter how poor
or ignorant, are softened and refined.</p>

<p>It was this quality that made it possible for
her to write that inimitable comedy of manners,
<i>Cranford</i>. Her other novels with their deep
pathos, strong passion, and dramatic situations
must be read to show the breadth of her powers,
but <i>Cranford</i> will always give its author a unique
place in literature. Imagine the material that
furnished the groundwork of this story put into
the hands of any novelist from Richardson to
Henry James. It seems almost like sacrilege
to think what even Jane Austen might have
said of these dear elderly ladies. As for Thackeray,
their little devices to keep up appearances
would have seemed to him instances of feminine
deceit, and he might have put even Miss Jenkyns
with her admiration of Dr. Johnson into
his <i>Book of Snobs</i>. What tears Dickens would
have drawn from our eyes over the love story
of Miss Matty and Mr. Holbrook. How George
Eliot would have mourned over the shallowness
of their lives. Henry James would have
squinted at them and their surroundings through
his eye-glass until he had discovered every faded
spot on the carpet or skilful darn in the curtain.
Miss Mitford would have appreciated these
ladies and loved them as did Mrs. Gaskell, only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
she would have been so interested in the flowers
and birds and clouds that she would have forgotten
all about the Cranford parties, and would
probably have ignored the presence in their
midst of the Honourable Mrs. Jamieson, the
sister-in-law of an earl. So we must conclude
that only Mrs. Gaskell could make immortal this
village of femininity, where to be a man was
considered almost vulgar, but into which she
has introduced one of the most chivalrous
gentlemen in the person of Captain Browne,
and one of the most faithful of lovers in the
person of Mr. Holbrook, while no book has
a more lovable heroine than fluttering, indecisive
Miss Matty, over whose fifty odd years the
sorrows of her youth have cast their lengthening
shadows.</p>

<p><i>Mary Barton</i> is a work of genius. Only a
woman of high ideals could have drawn the
character of Margaret Hale, an earlier Marcella,
or Molly Gibson, or Mr. Thornton, or Mr. Holman.
Only a woman of deep insight could have
created a woman like Ruth: a book which in its
problem and its deep earnestness reminds one
of <i>Aurora Leigh</i>. But her readers will always
love Mrs. Gaskell for the sake of the gentle
ladies of <i>Cranford</i>.</p>

<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>


<p>Mrs. Gaskell died on the twelfth of
November, 1865. Of the novelists who
have been considered in this book only three
survived her, Mrs. Bray, Mrs. S. C. Hall, and
Harriet Martineau, but they added little to prose
fiction after that date. During the third quarter
of the nineteenth century, however, the number
of books written by women continued to increase
each year. Julia Kavanagh was the
author of several novels, the first of which
<i>The Three Paths</i>, was published in 1848; all her
stories were written with high moral aim and
delicacy of feeling. <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>, by
Harriet Beecher Stowe, published in 1850, is
probably the most powerful novel ever written
to plead the cause of oppressed humanity.
Dinah Maria Muloch Craik kept up the interest
in the domestic novel; her most popular book,
<i>John Halifax, Gentleman</i>, has lost none of its
charm for young women, even if it does not meet
the requirements of a classic. Mrs. Henry Wood
is still remembered as the author of the melodramatic
<i>East Lynne</i>, but her best stories are the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
<i>Johnny Ludlow Papers</i>, which deal with character
alone; her popularity is attested by the
fact that more than a million copies of her books
have been issued. Charlotte Yonge's forgotten
novels were classed among the <i>Church Stories</i>,
because they contain so much piety and devotion.
Of a different type was Miss de la
Ram&eacute;e, who wrote under the name of Ouid&agrave;;
she had fine gifts of word-painting, but a fondness
for the questionable in conduct. Miss
Braddon, the author of <i>Lady Audley's Secret</i>,
excelled in complicated plots. Mrs. Oliphant
has been a most versatile writer, and followed
almost every style of prose fiction; her domestic
stories are generally considered her best.
Anne Thackeray, better known as Mrs. Ritchie,
the daughter of the great novelist, has written
several novels, all of which have a delightfully
feminine touch. Miss Rhoda Broughton has
entertained the reading public by love stories
which hold the attention until the marriage takes
place. But all these women fade into insignificance
beside George Eliot, whose first story,
<i>The Sad Fortunes of the Rev. Amos Barton</i>,
appeared in <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i> in 1857, and
whose last novel, <i>Daniel Deronda</i>, was published
nearly twenty years later, in 1876.</p>

<p>It seems strange that any reader of her books
should have thought them the product of a
man's brain, as was at first believed. For,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
notwithstanding her power in developing a plot,
her breadth of view, and her mental grasp, her
genius is essentially feminine. She excelled
in analysis of character, in attention to details,
in ethical teaching, and in artistic truthfulness,
the qualities in which women have been pre-eminent.
Only a woman's pen could have
drawn such characters as Dinah Morris, Maggie
Tulliver, and Dorothea Casaubon, or could
have followed the minute and subtle influences
under which the plot of <i>Middlemarch</i> is shaped.
George Eliot has left a larger portrait gallery
of women than any other novelist. Not only
has she drawn different grades of society, but,
what is perhaps a more difficult task, she has
drawn the different grades of spiritual greatness
and moral littleness. She brought the psychological
novel to a degree of perfection which has
never been surpassed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Oliphant has thus written of George Eliot's
place in literature:</p>

<p>"Another question which has been constantly
put to this age, and which is pushed with
greater zeal every day, as to the position of
women in literature and the height which it is
in their power to attain, was solved by this
remarkable woman, in a way most flattering
to all who were and are fighting the question of
equality between the two halves of mankind;
for here was visibly a woman who was to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
kept out by no barriers, who sat down quietly
from the beginning of her career in the highest
place, and, if she did not absolutely excel all
her contemporaries in the revelation of the
human mind and the creation of new human
beings, at least was second to none in those
distinguishing characteristics of genius."</p>

<p>We are too near the nineteenth century to
decide as to the relative positions of its great
novelists. At one time George Eliot was placed
at the head of all writers of fiction, with Dickens
and Thackeray as rivals for the second place.
But she was dethroned by Thackeray, and there
are signs that the final kingship will be given to
Charles Dickens, unless Scott receives it instead.</p>

<p>Fashions in novels change at least every fifty
years. Exciting plots and situations, strong
emotional scenes, sharp contrasts, are not demanded
by present readers, who also turn away
with disgust from the saintly heroine and the irreclaimable
villain. Of the many volumes of fiction
written in the eighteenth century only two are
in general circulation to-day, <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>
and <i>The Vicar of Wakefield</i>. But all those once
popular novels, even if their very names are
now forgotten, have done their work in shaping
the thought and morals of their own and succeeding
generations.</p>
